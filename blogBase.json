It belongs to the real of cognition (its \u201cexistence\u201d not ontological but **phenomenological**).\r\n- Ethnicity (and race, and nationhood) is a **social construct**: it is created and changes through social interactions and symbolic actions.\r\n- Ethnic boundary making often through **inter-group competition**.\r\n- Ethnicity has serious implications for people's lives.\r\n\r\n## _Jekins_: What is being constructed? \r\n- Category's boundaries\r\n- Beliefs about the traits or cultural contents that mark differences between 'us' and them\u201d\r\n\r\n## Characteristics of the ethnic boundaries\r\n- Ethnic boundaries are **fluid**.\r\n- Ethnic boundaries are sometimes **blurred**.\r\n- These principles contrast with common sensical view of ethnicity (and race and nation).\r\n\r\n## The development of the boundaries approach to ethnicity\r\n- **Classic cultural anthropology** \u2192 Barth \u2192 Post Barth\r\n> Classic cultural anthropology classified ethnic and racial groups based on supposed objective traits.\r\n> Classification system reflected power relations imperialism and colonialism)\r\n\r\n## _Barth_: Ojective definition of ethnic boundries\r\n- **Relationality**. Ethnic groups are not developed in isolation, but through **interactions** with other groups (key observation: people cross ethnic boundaries!). \r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> Groups are not defined by their culture, which is not an objective unique identifier (there are in-group differences and there are shared traits with out-groups) and changes over time. Ethnicity is a form of **social organization**.\r\n- What matters is the **subjective demarcation** of boundaries between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d by people in the field.\r\n- Ethnic boundaries limit and prescribe social interactions.\r\n-  Research should focus on the actions through which ethnic boundaries maintain or change.\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> There are no objective cultural markers of groups. Instead, people on the ground decide which cultural materials matter for their collective identity.\r\n\r\n## Post Barth Research\r\n- Greater emphasis on the fluidity of ethnic boundaries.\r\n- Interest in the links between symbolic boundaries and social boundaries.\r\n- Situational ethnicity/ethnicity as cognition\r\n- Setting the limits to constructivism\r\n\r\n## Social Boundary and Symbolic Boundary\r\n### 1. Social Boundary\r\n- Social boundaries refer to the tangible and observable divisions that exist in the real world, separating and distinguishing different social groups. \r\n- These divisions can be based on various factors such as geography, ethnicity, class, religion, or political affiliations. \r\n- Social boundaries can influence the distribution of resources, power dynamics, and social interactions among individuals and groups. \r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> Social boundaries are **objective** and have a **physical** presence, often manifested in institutional structures and societal norms.\r\n### 2. Symbolic Boundary\r\n- Symbolic boundaries are conceptual and constructed through cultural and symbolic representations. \r\n- They involve the ways in which individuals and groups differentiate themselves and others based on shared meanings, values, and beliefs. \r\n- Symbolic boundaries are not necessarily tied to physical or spatial separations; instead, they are rooted in the realm of ideas, language, and cultural practices. \r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> Symbolic boundaries are **subjective** and only have an **abstract** presence, they influence perceptions of identity, belonging, and group membership.\r\n### Relationsips between Social and Symbolic boundaries\r\n- Symbolic boundaries can **reinforce or challenge** social boundaries\r\n> Cultural representations and symbolic markers can strengthen group cohesion and reinforce social boundaries, leading to a sense of 'us versus them.' Conversely, symbolic boundaries can also be used to challenge and contest existing social boundaries, contributing to social change and transformation.\r\n- Social boundaries can **be legitimized** through symbolic boundaries\r\n> The way a society conceptualizes and represents different social groups, often through media, language, and cultural practices, can legitimize and perpetuate existing social boundaries, either maintaining or reproducing social inequalities.\r\n- Social boundaries may **influence the formation** of symbolic boundaries\r\n> The material conditions and power dynamics associated with social boundaries can shape the ways in which groups construct their symbolic boundaries. For example, oppressed or marginalized groups may use symbolic resistance as a means to challenge the dominant social order.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> What is similar and what is different about the relationships of ethnicity with language and with religion?\r\n> ### Similar:\r\n> - Religion sometimes serves as a marker of ethnicity, but the two **do not fully overlap**. \r\n> - Highlighting religious differences is a political processes _(e.g., to justify claims for material, political, or symbolic resources)_\r\n> ### Difference:\r\n> - Sometimes, religion becomes a trans-ethnic or trans-national identity. \r\n> - Religions provide materials for thick ethnic (or national) identities: idioms, myths, and symbols that add moral and affective load to group membership.\r\n> - Religious organizations participate in ethnic (or national) identity **construction and socialization**.\r\n\r\n## Further viewpoints\r\n- Culture marks ethnic boundaries, but it also gives content and meaning to **identities** _(\u201cthick identity\u201d)_.\r\n- This does not mean that we should essentialize ethnic or national culture.\r\n- Ethnic and national groups are sites of struggles over the meanings attached to **a collective identity** (e.g., different beliefs about the group\u2019s history, its core values, etc., sometimes also about symbolic boundaries).\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n# Boundary Work and Shifts\r\n## _Nagel_: What caused large-scale ethnic switching? What caused the **fluidity**?\r\n- Federal policy\r\n- Ethnic politics\r\n- Political activism, shared fate, pride, and inspiration\r\n\r\n## Characteristics of fluid boundaries:\r\n- **Cultural differentiation**\r\n> i.e., identifying certain cultural traits, habits, behaviors, etc. as typical for \u201cus\u201d or for \u201cthem\u201d\r\n- **Social closure**\r\n> closure and differentiation tend to reinforce each other\r\n- **Political salience**\r\n> \u201cthick\u201d identities reduce the range of possible political actions; ethnic politics tends to reinforce differentiation and closure\r\n\r\n## Boundary work\r\n- The phenomenon of individuals or groups **creating, maintaining, adjusting, or breaking through** various boundaries in society, such as ethnic, cultural, social, etc., **to shape identity, group relationships, and social interactions**.\r\n- Ethnic categories may **expand or contract** (a focal topic in ethnic studies) due to boundary work.\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> _Wimmer_: People have repertoires of identities to chose from. Their choices may change when institutional incentives change. So, **repertories \u2260 situational ethnicity**.\r\n\r\n## Components of Boundary Work\r\n- **Type of boundary**\r\n> which criteria for similarity/difference (e.g., ethnicity, race, gender, nationality, generation) is highlighted in the pursue or recognition and/or political power?\r\n- **Type of strategy**\r\n> e.g., boundary crossing; normative inversion; expansion; contraction\r\n- **Location of boundary**\r\n> membership rule: what is the criterion or threshold for being one of \u201cus\u201d?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n# Pan-ethnicity, situational ethnicity, the limit of constructivism\r\n## Situational Ethnicity\r\n-  Individuals or groups actively choosing to emphasize or express a specific ethnic identity in a particular context. \r\n- This identity is determined by the current social environment, social situations, or specific contexts, and may change due to different situations.\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> Individuals or groups selectively emphasize or conceal their ethnic identity based on different social contexts to **adapt to different social needs or express a sense of belonging**. \r\n\r\n## Impacts of (activated) ethnic identification (self or other) on social interactions\r\n-  Cognitive schemes of interpretation (_Brubaker\uff1aEthnicity as Cognition_)\r\n- Affective dispositions (sometimes _hot cognition_)\r\n- Behavioral tendencies\r\n- But interactions can also generate shifts in the above _(e.g., contact theory)_\r\n\r\n## Two types of variation in ethnic identification\r\n- **Temporal** (i.e., the conditions that evoke different degrees and expressions of ethnic identification).\r\n> e.g., In certain specific social events or cultural celebrations, individuals may express their ethnic identity more strongly, while in other everyday contexts, ethnic identity may be relatively weak or less prominent.\r\n- **Cross-sectional**: hierarchies of identities (i.e., identities\u2019 relative degree of salience).\r\n> e.g., A person may emphasize their professional identity more in the workplace, while emphasizing their ethnic identity more at family gatherings.\r\n\r\n## Instrumental ethnicity\r\n- Sometimes ethnicity is used instrumentally, but that is because it has been **internalized** and is considered **primordial**. \r\n- Also, there is a difference between superficial act of signaling and deep act of adopting/embracing an identity.\r\n- The content of ethnic identity functions as a **filter** through which personal and collective goals are defined and sorted.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Managing ethnic diversity\r\n## What is a nation?\r\n### Defition: \r\n_Anderson (Imagined Communities, p.6):_ An imagined political community-and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign. \r\n### What composes this definition?\r\n- **Imagined**\r\n> Even in the smallest of all nations, a member will **never** know, meet, or event hear about most other members. However, the shared nation 'exists' in the consciousness of its members.\r\n- **Limited**\r\n> People imagined nations as **bounded**: in our minds, the world population is divided to distinct nations. Perceived criteria for national membership. There are Rules for how to join 'our' nation.\r\n- **Sovereign**\r\n> The nation is perceived by its members and outsiders who recognize its existence as sovereign or at least entitled to sovereignty. That makes the nation a **political community**: nations should **run their own business based on shared goals**.\r\n- **Community**\r\n> The nation as an extended family or fraternity: a group whose members **share an equality at a profound level**. A community of feelings, solidarity, loyalty, and sometimes sacrifice (of people who are mostly **anonymous** to each other and also **unequal** in many respects).\r\n\r\n## How are (some) of the components may be related to ethnicity and interethnic relations?\r\n- Nationhood (_sovereign_) and Nation-ness (_internal unity and cohesion_)\r\n- A community of feelings and shared fate via the cultural stuff\r\n- Ethnic mythology and symbols in the service of nationalism\r\n- Myths of origin and antiquity\r\n- A scared land via 'poetic spaces' _(e.g., archeological sites, battle fields, monuments, national map)._\r\n- Golden age, national heroes. \r\n- The collective past as a moral yardstick for evaluating the present and blueprint for the future via collective goals _(i.e., national revival)._\r\n\r\n## What is nation-state?\r\n- A **territorially bounded sovereign** polity-ie., a state - that is **ruled in the name of a community** of citizens who **identify themselves as a nation**.\r\n- A fusion of two principles: **state** sovereignty and **national** sovereignty.\r\n- Nation-state institutions nurture **national sentiments**.\r\n> For members of the nation, 'their' state (which they usually see as their homeland) is the object of love, commitment or yearning.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> This definition highlights that **the authority of governments** of nation-state is based on the **claim-made inwards** (i.e., the people) and **outwards** (i.e., the international community)-that the government rules in the name of a nation.\r\n\r\n## Solutions to the problem of incongruence of cultural and political boundaries\r\n### Reducing / eliminating diversity\uff1a\r\n- Oppression (by authoritarian regimes)\r\n- Ethnic cleansing\r\n\ufeff- Assimilation policies through centralized education and cultural institutions\r\n### Managing diversity: \r\n- Political arrangements that contain ethnic diversity and reduce conflict\r\n\r\n## Typology of Democracies\r\n- Republican liberal\r\n- Individual liberal\r\n- Consociational\r\n- Multicultural\r\n- \ufeff\ufeffEthnic democracy\r\n\r\n## Some of the challenges to inclusionary management of diversity\r\n- **Large migrations** \r\n> less assimilation + postnational incorporation (_Soysal_); resistance by host societies\r\n- **Indigenous Movements** \r\n> request greater respect and protection for their culture and rights\r\n- The rise of **neo-nationalism** \r\n> resulting in exclusion of multiculturalism, and even triggering discrimination and hostility towards specific ethnic or cultural groups\r\n- Empowerment of **populist-authoritarian leaders**\r\n> tend to emphasize nationalism and xenophobia, and hold a hostile attitude towards ethnic minorities and immigrants\r\n\r\n## What is 'postliberal' politics / citizenship?\r\n- Demanding **recognition** in cultural uniqueness of ethnic minority _(resistance to complete assimilation)_.\r\n- Claiming **collective rights** for ethnic groups _(in addition to equal/just distribution of resources)_.\r\n- Demanding **autonomy** within the state for ethnic groups in their traditional territories.\r\n- Demanding maintenance and extension of **civil rights**.\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> Citizenship allows **contradictions** between autonomy and civil rights _(e.g., patriarchal norms)_\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Ethic stratification and inequality\r\n## What is a **Social Stratification**?\r\n- **Institutionalized** inequality (including legitimizing ideology)\r\n- Inequality between **social categories**\r\n- Inequality in access to different types of **resources** _(e.g., economic, political, legal, health, etc.)_\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n>Ethnic stratification: A state of at least **partial alignment** of ethnic division and social stratification.\r\n\r\n## How does status translate into economic advantages?\r\n- Ethnic division of **labor** (monopoly over certain occupations)\r\n- **Endogamy** (marriage as an economic exchange)\r\n- **Stereotypes** (affect the judgment of employment, landlords, policemen, judges, etc.)\r\n- **Ideology** may justify alignment of status and class\r\n\r\n## Ethnic stratification via **Political Arrangements**\r\n- Ethnic stratification in **colonial and postcolonial** states\r\n- **Global stratification** (_citizenship as a resource_)\r\n> There is an unequal distribution of opportunities, privileges, and resources among individuals and groups in different countries or regions. \r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> In this context, citizenship is seen as a valuable resource that **grants individuals specific rights, protections, and benefits** based on their country of origin or nationality.\r\n\r\n- **Group discrimination** by state institutions\r\n- Differential access to certain **jobs**\r\n- Mechanisms of inclusion/exclusion of **immigrants** based on their ethnicities\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Assimilation/Integration/Segregation/Incorporation of Immigrant Ethnic minorities\r\n## _Portes and Zhou_: Three types of **Acculturation Approach**:\r\n- **Adoption** of the dominant culture and assimilation in the **middle-class**.\r\n- **Adoption** of a counter-culture and assimilation in **lower classes**.\r\n- Social and economic **mobility** through maintenance of an ethnic group's culture, values, and solidarity.\r\n\r\n## The Impact of the Context in the Receiving Country and Society\r\n- Government policy: receptive, indifferent, or hostile\r\n- Societal reception: Prejudiced or nonprejudiced\r\n- Co-ethnic community: Weak or strong\r\n\r\n## What drives certain groups to 'choose' differentiation/assimilation?\r\n- Skin color\r\n- Place of residence\r\n- Economic shifts\r\n- Capacity to utilize them though different types of capital\r\n\r\n## The long-term effects of the 'context'\r\n- **Government's assistance** to immigrants improves their children's (and their children's) mobility chances.\r\n- Sometime **negative stereotypes** persist for generations.\r\n- Immigrant's decision to join strong ethnic community may affect the **mobility of their offspring**.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Ethnic Violence\r\n## Types of ethnic violence\r\n-  Ethnic riot \r\n- Lynch  \r\n- Pogrom \r\n- Ethnocide _(of culture)_\r\n- Genocide (of people)\r\n- Inter-state wars may include an ethnic component\r\n- Civil wars\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> Some ethnic conflicts include **more than one** type of violence.\r\n\r\n## Previous reasons for collective violence\uff1a\r\n- Violence is **natural**; a human tendency that had developed through evolution.\r\n- **Socialization** to violence\r\n> (a) arguments about **failed socialization**; (b) arguments about socialization to **non-normative behavior**.\r\n- **Psychoanalytical** argument\r\n> e.g., (a) violence as **externalization of interna tensions**; (b) violence as projection of suppressed traumatic social relationships (for instance, _child-parents or child-teacher_).\r\n- **Crowd** psychology\r\n> people become violent during collective action that causes **de-individuation and extasy**\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> Classic arguments are partial explanation that point to possible roots of **people\u2019s motivation** to participate in ethnic violence, but they **cannot explain instances** of ethnic violence.\r\n\r\n## _Ted Robert Gurr_: Reasons for ethnic violence\r\n- The basis of violence is frustration (frustration-aggression theory).\r\n- Frustration stems from relative deprivation (not necessarily economic).\r\n- An ethnic group\u2019s leadership utilizes feelings of frustration and anger to mobilize them for protest and violence. Sometimes this is done as a cold-minded strategy.\r\n\r\n## Characteristics of Ethnic Riot\r\n- Brutal\r\n- Highly passionate, but with clear patterns \r\n> e.g., target selection, common order: trigger event, rumors spread, escalation, (expansion to other places), decline.\r\n- Violence as meaning for **participants**\r\n- Violence has **general and immediate causes** \r\n> distal/proximate causes\r\n> Violence reflects ethnic/racial **cleavages**, but it is not a necessary outcome of the cleavages\r\n- A process with internal dynamic\r\n- **Trigger** events often have special **symbolic meanings**\r\n- **Leaders** may provoke feelings of frustration, rage, hatred, and fear\r\n> including by employing elements of **collective memory**\r\n- **Rumors** are a key mechanism of mass mobilization for active or passive support.\r\n- **Aggressive reaction** by the rival validate negative feelings and sense of righteousness, thus propagate violence\r\n- Violence converts negative feelings to **positive feelings**\r\n> solidarity, pride, hope, even euphoria _(Tambiah: Jubilant Destruction)_\r\n\r\n## _Wimmer_: The Political Context of Violent Ethnic Conflicts\r\n- Statistical association between ethnic violence and **political competition and exclusion**\r\n> \u2013 Ethnic uprising is more common in **ethnocracies**.\r\n> \u2013 Ethnic violence (especially coup attempts) is more common when ruling is divided between the **elites** of several ethnic groups.\r\n> \u2013 Ethnic uprising and coup attempts are more common in countries where an **ethnic minority has a history of controlling** part or the entire territory. \r\n- Ethnic violence during the **collapse** of a polity \r\n> e.g., the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia. Mechanisms: political opportunity, contagion, security dilemma.\r\n- Violence during or after **elections** \r\n> e.g., Kenya 2007-8 following rumors that the elections were stolen from the Kikuyu.\r\n- Cities with **intense political competition** experience more ethnic violence\r\n\r\n## How people choose attitudes towards violence?\r\n- **Rational choice**: Expected benefits/risks\r\n> Mechanisms: Social control, policing\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> It is possible that rational choice is more typical of specific phases of conflicts (e.g., after escalation or when it gets clearer who is going to win)\r\n\r\n- **Symbolic politics**: Participation in violence is emotional and sentimental (especially hatred and rage toward the enemy).\r\n> Mechanisms: \r\n> - People\u2019s tendency to protect their group from symbolic threats or existential threats\r\n> - Elite\u2019s manipulative use of ethnic myths and symbols to provoke hatred, rage, and fear of the enemy + internal solidarity and excitement \r\n> - Symbolic politics flattens identities, creates \u201ccollective mind\u201d: identity dichotomy (us/them), stereotypical thinking (good/evil) \r\n> - Affective reactions: positive feelings about the home group and negative feelings about the enemy\r\n> - A spiral of revenge and escalation \r\n- **Institutionalized violence**: Routinization and ritualization of violence\r\n> Circumstances and Mechanisms: \r\n> - Non-violent ethnic protests deteriorates to violence\r\n> - Actors that keep the ethnic conflicts \u201cburning\u201d (some of them provoke violence during crises : politicians, religious leaders, mural painters, gangs, local media\r\n> - Many ordinary people have experience, or at least memories from past episodes of violence: they \u201cknow\u201d what their role is likely to be; they remember the solidarity and elation they felt; they may wait for an opportunity for revenge\r\n> - Therefore, the violence process looks like a ritual with clear roles and a predicted pattern of development\r\n> - In some cities, violence is expected, almost trivial\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> The three attitudes are **not mutually exclusive** and may appear as one or multiple simultaneously\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1721482279, "style": "<style>.markdown-alert{padding:0.5rem 1rem;margin-bottom:1rem;border-left:.25em solid

fleeting moments  \r\n* Painted scenes that looked fuzzy and unrefined  \r\n* Used short, quick brush strokes  \r\n* Key artists: Monet, Degas, Pissarro   \r\n  * Monet: uses natural pastel hue   \r\n* Motivation: create the impression of a moment (idea comes from realism), focuses on lighting  \r\n\r\n**Post Impressionism** \r\n\r\n* Artists move further away from academic naturalism (towards abstraction)  \r\n* Strong influence non-European art and culture (Japanese prints, Primitivism)  \r\n* Key Artists: Gauguin, Van Gogh  \r\n  * Expressive color  \r\n  * Painting as subjective expression: how art can evoke emotions   \r\n  * Painting as escape from anxieties of modern life  \r\n* Cezanne, Seurat  \r\n  * Geometric stability  \r\n  * Attention to form and structure  \r\n  * Seurat: manipulates color, develops pointillism \r\n\r\nGauguin, *Vision after the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel)*, 1888\r\n\r\n* Post impressionism   \r\n* Color: white and red/ impasto red dramatic   \r\n* Theosophy   \r\n* Breton women, dressed in distinctive regional costume, have just listened to a sermon based on a passage from the Bible  \r\n* Background: divided by diagonal tree trunk   \r\n* Gauguin First religious picture, wanted to give it to a church  \r\n* Churches denied lol \r\n\r\n#### 1/18 Modernism & The female Nude: Picasso's Les demoiselles d' Avigonon\r\n\r\n**Context:**   \r\n1907  \r\nHow the painting represents the relationship between the female nude and modernism  \r\nHistory of western art and the Renaissance   \r\nImmediate context in which Picasso made this painting   \r\nGeneral reception of the painting \r\n\r\nPicasso:\r\n\r\n- Known as the inventor of cubism   \r\n- Known for Guernica (anti-war painting in 1937\\)\r\n\r\nModern art: why is it ugly LMAO  \r\nWhy would an artist paint like this \r\n\r\n- Picasso skilled at naturalism, creating an image that looks lifelike   \r\n- An opportunity to think about abstraction   \r\n- Abstraction is about deconstruction of representation   \r\n- A result of specific set of choices \r\n\r\nWithin the western tradition, long history of images/ sculpture of nude figures   \r\nAt the center of Greek art was the male nude (Michelangelo\u2019s David; Antonio\u2019s Perseus)\r\n\r\n- Male figure \\- heroic   \r\n- The accurate depiction of male nude \\- highest level of artist achievement \r\n\r\nIn contrast, female nude:\r\n\r\n- Nude image of female had an erotic function   \r\n- William Hogarth, Marriagea la Mode: curtain drawn over a female nude bc it\u2019s so overly erotic   \r\n- Titles like: sleeping venus; Rokeby Venus; the Toilette of Venus (god of love) \\-\\> a mythological pretext for her nudity  \r\n- Distort female body to show more nudity  \r\n- Emerged in the context of italian renaissance that insisted upon the gap of the functions of male and female nudity \r\n\r\nEdouard Manuet \\- broke the historical tradition \r\n\r\n- Olympia, 1863 (referencing Venus of Urbino) \\- first modernist painting   \r\n  - Depicts the modern life  \r\n  - Declares the surface of painting, acknowledges the existence of the canvas   \r\n  - Frankness of her stare suggests a transactional relationship btw viewers of the painting and her  \r\n  - Flowers brought to her by a woman who\u2019s her servant (African descent) from her next client   \r\n- A hinge btw the history of reclining female nude and its modern iteration  \r\n- Deliberately updates the figure, no longer a mythological figure of Venus but explicitly a modern sex worker   \r\n- The way in which he compressed the space (compared to Venus of Urbino) \\- darkness \u2192 shallow background, brightness of white presses forward   \r\n  - Establishes a precedent of avant garde shock that happens through the female nude\r\n\r\nPaul Gauguin, Copy of Manuet\u2019s Olympia 1891\r\n\r\n- A deliberate conversation   \r\n- Modernism is worked through the body of female nude  \r\n    \r\n  Sex workers/ women, an emblem of modernism \u201cThe New Woman\u201d  \r\n- The beautiful girl 1919  \r\n- Street, berlin, 1913\r\n\r\nPaul Cezanne, The large bathers, 1906\r\n\r\n- He challenges the fundamental assumptions of naturalism  \r\n- Ex: this work depicts the real world but also presents itself as a painting through  \r\n  - The breaking open of form (the distortion of tree branches; the relationship between the trunk and the sky)\r\n\r\nMatisse paints Bonheur de vive (in conversation w the painting above)\r\n\r\n- Abstraction  \r\n- Emptying out of form  \r\n- Emphasis on outline  \r\n- Discrete scenes: idealized and pastoral   \r\n- Trying to create a modern, classical grandeur   \r\n- Pleasing to look at\r\n\r\nGertrude Stein: hangs up this painting, seen by Picasso   \r\nPicasso was in the process of painting the portrait of Gertrude Stein, saw Matisse\u2019s painting as a challenge and came up w Les Demoiselles d Avignon  \r\n\r\n- The painting of Gertrude Stein reflects his interest in form\r\n\r\n**Les Demoiselles d Avignon** (Symbolic of Picasso\u2019s misogyny and racism)  \r\nNo pastoral setting, no bright colors  \r\neverything is angular    \r\nRed light district in Barcelona (Spanish sex workers)  \r\nShallow space \u2192 compression achieved through a lack of background detail; a tangled of bodies; disproportion of faces  \r\nstylistic dysjunction (multiple styles happening in one painting)\r\n\r\n- Faces resemble \u2192 Dan mask; Baule mask \u2192 signifies Africaness/ a monstrosity\r\n\r\nFlatness of figures   \r\nPresence of a reclining figure (second on the left)\r\n\r\n- Makes more sense if she were to be lying down  \r\n- Rendering her hinged up at the viewers  \r\n- Further compresses the space, a furthering of abstraction  \r\n- What does that achieve?   \r\n  - The figure becomes confrontational   \r\n  - Gazes are multiplied (compared to Olympia), extending the dialogue  \r\n  - Olympia confronts the everyday male viewer w his own practices of sexuality and how that\u2019s comodified   \r\n  - Whereas Picasso is aiming to further the shock factor, to further highlight to the male viewers the banality of the everyday life; updates a classic genre, intentionally   \r\n    - Through the extension of flattening, the multiplication of gazes  \r\n- Figure on the very left  \r\n  - Holding open a curtain for viewers to survey her body\r\n\r\nNowhere for the eyes to go, attention gets thrown back to the foreground  \r\n(white and black are used to render volume, which the painting lacks)  \r\nThe fruit at the bottom of the canvas \r\n\r\n- Putting viewers at the table, engaging with and confronting the women directly\r\n\r\nUnderstood as a formal innovation that led to Cubism \r\n\r\nPrimitivism in 20th C.: Western writers conceive the cultural other as an authenticity, as a sight of other than themselves, rather than reflecting about the differences \r\n\r\nRinggold, Picasso\u2019s Studio\r\n\r\n- Picasso becomes a side character in the story of modernism \r\n\r\n#### 1/23 Post-Impressionism (Continue)\r\n\r\nDivisionism: reflecting on the division of plane into infinite dots  \r\nPointillism \r\n\r\n- Two directions that artists go to engage w colors (differentiation vs synthesis) \r\n\r\n###### *Georges Seurat*\r\n\r\nInterested in scientific approach to color, to bringing stability and classical quality to impressionism   \r\nAnd thinking about class in the contemporary context\r\n\r\n* Bathers at

Basket of apples 1893  \r\n  * Stuffy genre \u2192 still life   \r\n  * Creating a scene w multiple diff perspectives   \r\n  * Edge of table doesn\u2019t line up, the corners don\u2019t match  \r\n  * Thick application of paint for napkin: Creating a sense of structure, of folds  \r\n  * Overall composition: disorienting   \r\n    * Trying to paint in a way that reflect the way our eyes engage w paintings \u2192 not linear, not single point perspective; our eyes wander around   \r\n    * Breaking the standard criteria of composition since Renaissance which is the idea of a unified image (\u2192 painting has to present one thing from one view) \\- Deconstruction of tradition   \r\n    * Representation vs reality: how painting constructs representation   \r\n    * Interested in the materiality of color; Brush strokes: constructing forms w paint   \r\n* Mont sainte Victoire 1885  \r\n  * Disintegration of form   \r\n  * Lack of outline: truck of tree vs un outlined zone next to

Stacked up vertically, no sense of space   \r\n  * Bleeding of forms \\- breaking open of form itself; form isn\u2019t a coherent thing, designated by outlines or not; Key principle that Cezanne is challenging   \r\n  * Analysis of representation through the materiality of painting   \r\n* The Large Bathers 1906  \r\n* Bathers 1894-1905  \r\n  * Drawing on a tradition of scenes of bathers   \r\n    * idealized natural setting, mythological context (Diana and Callisto 1635; Pastoral Symphony 1510\\)  \r\n    * Bathing: pretext for nudity   \r\n  * Cezanne and Seurat continue the tradition  \r\n    * Interest in using new techniques to engage traditional subjects \r\n\r\nImpressionists: Momentarily experience w naturalism   \r\nPost impressionist: artist capture their own experience in a subjective way \r\n\r\n- Everyone is motivated by the desire to access truth, to make a painting that feels true and real, whether its through personal temperament or objective perspective   \r\n- Idea of Expressionism is emerging \r\n\r\n###### *Chronology of Matisse & Fauvism* \r\n\r\nSalon d\u2019Automne, 1905\r\n\r\n* Key moment of Fauvism  \r\n  * Short lived movement, influential, head figure: Matisse  \r\n  * Matisse \\+ Picasso   \r\n  * Two different approach to modernism: Matisse \\- Characterized by his use of color; Picasso \\- Interested in form \r\n\r\nPaul Signac: advocate

exist on a surface; it\u2019s not decorative   \r\n* Analysis of the nature of representation   \r\n  * Representation: Imitation of likeness   \r\n  * You can describe something that help viewers conjure their own image (there are non representational mode of painting)  \r\n  * From the iconic to the linguistic mode of representation  \r\n    * The signifer and the signified (the relationship is arbitrary) \r\n\r\nCollage\r\n\r\nPicasso \r\n\r\n* Move from naturalism to impressionism (date?)  \r\n* Blue Period 1902  \r\n* Rose Period 1905 (post-impressionism)  \r\n* Interest in Iberian

Vs. *Mont Sainte Victoire* by Cezanne  \r\n  * A more limited color palette, a simplification of form   \r\n  * No sky, horizon line, creates a feeling of the form spilling forward rather than receding back   \r\n  * The shading is not working in the opposite way  \r\n    * Typically the light is closer to the audience and the shadow is further away   \r\n    * Creating the sense that the volume is concave instead of convex \r\n\r\nPicasso *Three Women* 1908\r\n\r\n* Every form is a triangle  \r\n* Less cubes than facets   \r\n* the different placement of the uniformed units signified the object \u2013 gets into the question of signification \u2192  triangle in and of itself doesn\u2019t indicate elbows but the placement of them created an elbow  \r\n  * Relational model of meaning

Multiple perspective:  access to the front and the side at the same time   \r\n* Structuring of the backgroun such that it occupies the same plane as the object  \r\n* Cubism: a lot of musical

Midterm Concept Review: \r\n\r\n**1886-1905 Post-Impressionism**\r\n\r\n* reaction against Impressionists' concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and color  \r\n* sought to bring a more systematic approach to the structure and form of painting  \r\n* Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and Paul C\u00e9zanne all shared an interest in making art that went beyond the mere representation of the natural world, focusing instead on expressing more abstract, emotional, and spiritual concepts\r\n\r\nSynthetism (subset of Post-impressionism)\r\n\r\n* Key figure: Paul Gauguin  \r\n  * Particularly his work in Tahiti: synthesized the outward appearance of the subject matter with the artist's feelings about the subject and the aesthetics of the painting itself (does it also fall under primitivism?)  \r\n* emphasizes two-dimensional flat patterns, thus rejecting three-dimensional perspective  \r\n* Characterized by the use of bold flat forms separated by dark contours  \r\n* Using color symbolically rather than realistically \r\n\r\nNeoimpressionism (another subset of post-impressionism)\r\n\r\n* response to Impressionism: interested in applying scientific research in optics and color theory to create a more harmonious and structured form of art compared to the more spontaneous and subjective approach of the Impressionists  \r\n* Key figures: Georges Seurat and Paul Signac  \r\n* most famous for its development of Pointillism (or Divisionism), a technique involving the application of paint in small dots of pure color, which are intended to blend in the viewer's eye\r\n\r\n**1900-1908 Fauvism (transitional stage to Cubism)**\r\n\r\n* pure, brilliant colour aggressively applied straight from the paint tubes to create a sense of an explosion on the canvas  \r\n* Focus on nature (like the Impressionists)   \r\n* Key figure: Matisse  \r\n  * reject traditional renderings of three-dimensional space and to seek instead a new picture space defined by movement of colour\r\n\r\n**1908-1929 Cubism**\r\n\r\n* Key figures: Picasso, Braque   \r\n* Emphasized flat, two-dimensional surface of the picture plane   \r\n* rejecting the traditional techniques of perspective, foreshortening, modeling, and chiaroscuro  \r\n* refuting theories that art should imitate nature\r\n\r\nAnalytic Cubism (1910-1912)\r\n\r\n* While they moved away from naturalistic representation, they are very interested in the idea of representations and different modes of representation   \r\n* Breaking down, analysis of form, display the essence of an object (or the complex totality of its subject) from multiple perspectives in a single two-dimensional framework  \r\n* Picasso and Braque: simplified their colour schemes to a nearly monochromatic scale (hues of tan, brown, gray, cream, green, or blue were preferred) in order not to distract the viewer from the artist\u2019s primary interest\u2014the structure of form itself  \r\n* Semiotics: The relationship between the signifer and the signified   \r\n* What is the plane doing? move beyond the surface of the canvas rather than to recede in depth  \r\n* representational motifs: letters, musical instruments, glasses etc. \r\n\r\nSynthetic Cubism (Post 1912\\) \r\n\r\n* emphasize the combination, or synthesis, of forms in the picture  \r\n* Colour assumes a strong role in these works  \r\n* Shapes become more decorative   \r\n* Trompe l\u2019Oeil\\!\\!  \r\n  * emphasizes the differences in texture and, at the same time, poses the question of what is reality and what is illusion  \r\n* Key figures:  Fernand L\u00e9ger, Sonia Delaunay, Juan Gris, Marcel Duchamp, Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger\r\n\r\nSalon Cubism\r\n\r\n* Coined to describe the works and the artists of Cubism who exhibited in various Paris Salons  \r\n* Interested in the geometricizing of form\r\n\r\n**1905\u20131920 Expressionism**\r\n\r\n* artist seeks to depict not objective reality but rather the subjective emotions and responses that objects and events arouse within a person  \r\n* Key artists: Van Gogh, Die Br\u00fccke, Ludwig Kirchner  \r\n* artists used the expressive possibilities of colour and line to explore dramatic and emotion-laden themes, to convey the qualities of fear, horror, and the grotesque, or simply to celebrate nature with hallucinatory intensity\r\n\r\nDie Br\u00fccke 1905-1913\r\n\r\n* played a pivotal role in the development of Expressionism  \r\n* Emphasized raw, emotional expression through vivid colors and bold strokes  \r\n* founded by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner  \r\n* Wanted to defy conventions of traditional painting as well as Impressionism and Post-Impressionism  \r\n* subject matter\u2014the human figure, landscape, portraiture, still life\u2014executed in a simplified style that stressed bold outlines and strong colour planes\r\n\r\nDer Blaue Reiter 1911-1914\r\n\r\n* expressionistically oriented  \r\n* Focused on spiritual and symbolic interpretations of art, with Kandinsky as a leading member  \r\n* unlike Die Br\u00fccke, their expressionism took the form of lyrical abstraction.   \r\n* imbued their art with deep spiritual content  \r\n* influenced by the Jugendstil group, Cubism, Futurism, and \u201cnaive\u201d folk art\r\n\r\n\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1725595143, "style":
