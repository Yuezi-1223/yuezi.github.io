It belongs to the real of cognition (its \u201cexistence\u201d not ontological but **phenomenological**).\r\n- Ethnicity (and race, and nationhood) is a **social construct**: it is created and changes through social interactions and symbolic actions.\r\n- Ethnic boundary making often through **inter-group competition**.\r\n- Ethnicity has serious implications for people's lives.\r\n\r\n## _Jekins_: What is being constructed? \r\n- Category's boundaries\r\n- Beliefs about the traits or cultural contents that mark differences between 'us' and them\u201d\r\n\r\n## Characteristics of the ethnic boundaries\r\n- Ethnic boundaries are **fluid**.\r\n- Ethnic boundaries are sometimes **blurred**.\r\n- These principles contrast with common sensical view of ethnicity (and race and nation).\r\n\r\n## The development of the boundaries approach to ethnicity\r\n- **Classic cultural anthropology** \u2192 Barth \u2192 Post Barth\r\n> Classic cultural anthropology classified ethnic and racial groups based on supposed objective traits.\r\n> Classification system reflected power relations imperialism and colonialism)\r\n\r\n## _Barth_: Ojective definition of ethnic boundries\r\n- **Relationality**. Ethnic groups are not developed in isolation, but through **interactions** with other groups (key observation: people cross ethnic boundaries!). \r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> Groups are not defined by their culture, which is not an objective unique identifier (there are in-group differences and there are shared traits with out-groups) and changes over time. Ethnicity is a form of **social organization**.\r\n- What matters is the **subjective demarcation** of boundaries between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d by people in the field.\r\n- Ethnic boundaries limit and prescribe social interactions.\r\n-  Research should focus on the actions through which ethnic boundaries maintain or change.\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> There are no objective cultural markers of groups. Instead, people on the ground decide which cultural materials matter for their collective identity.\r\n\r\n## Post Barth Research\r\n- Greater emphasis on the fluidity of ethnic boundaries.\r\n- Interest in the links between symbolic boundaries and social boundaries.\r\n- Situational ethnicity/ethnicity as cognition\r\n- Setting the limits to constructivism\r\n\r\n## Social Boundary and Symbolic Boundary\r\n### 1. Social Boundary\r\n- Social boundaries refer to the tangible and observable divisions that exist in the real world, separating and distinguishing different social groups. \r\n- These divisions can be based on various factors such as geography, ethnicity, class, religion, or political affiliations. \r\n- Social boundaries can influence the distribution of resources, power dynamics, and social interactions among individuals and groups. \r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> Social boundaries are **objective** and have a **physical** presence, often manifested in institutional structures and societal norms.\r\n### 2. Symbolic Boundary\r\n- Symbolic boundaries are conceptual and constructed through cultural and symbolic representations. \r\n- They involve the ways in which individuals and groups differentiate themselves and others based on shared meanings, values, and beliefs. \r\n- Symbolic boundaries are not necessarily tied to physical or spatial separations; instead, they are rooted in the realm of ideas, language, and cultural practices. \r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> Symbolic boundaries are **subjective** and only have an **abstract** presence, they influence perceptions of identity, belonging, and group membership.\r\n### Relationsips between Social and Symbolic boundaries\r\n- Symbolic boundaries can **reinforce or challenge** social boundaries\r\n> Cultural representations and symbolic markers can strengthen group cohesion and reinforce social boundaries, leading to a sense of 'us versus them.' Conversely, symbolic boundaries can also be used to challenge and contest existing social boundaries, contributing to social change and transformation.\r\n- Social boundaries can **be legitimized** through symbolic boundaries\r\n> The way a society conceptualizes and represents different social groups, often through media, language, and cultural practices, can legitimize and perpetuate existing social boundaries, either maintaining or reproducing social inequalities.\r\n- Social boundaries may **influence the formation** of symbolic boundaries\r\n> The material conditions and power dynamics associated with social boundaries can shape the ways in which groups construct their symbolic boundaries. For example, oppressed or marginalized groups may use symbolic resistance as a means to challenge the dominant social order.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> What is similar and what is different about the relationships of ethnicity with language and with religion?\r\n> ### Similar:\r\n> - Religion sometimes serves as a marker of ethnicity, but the two **do not fully overlap**. \r\n> - Highlighting religious differences is a political processes _(e.g., to justify claims for material, political, or symbolic resources)_\r\n> ### Difference:\r\n> - Sometimes, religion becomes a trans-ethnic or trans-national identity. \r\n> - Religions provide materials for thick ethnic (or national) identities: idioms, myths, and symbols that add moral and affective load to group membership.\r\n> - Religious organizations participate in ethnic (or national) identity **construction and socialization**.\r\n\r\n## Further viewpoints\r\n- Culture marks ethnic boundaries, but it also gives content and meaning to **identities** _(\u201cthick identity\u201d)_.\r\n- This does not mean that we should essentialize ethnic or national culture.\r\n- Ethnic and national groups are sites of struggles over the meanings attached to **a collective identity** (e.g., different beliefs about the group\u2019s history, its core values, etc., sometimes also about symbolic boundaries).\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n# Boundary Work and Shifts\r\n## _Nagel_: What caused large-scale ethnic switching? What caused the **fluidity**?\r\n- Federal policy\r\n- Ethnic politics\r\n- Political activism, shared fate, pride, and inspiration\r\n\r\n## Characteristics of fluid boundaries:\r\n- **Cultural differentiation**\r\n> i.e., identifying certain cultural traits, habits, behaviors, etc. as typical for \u201cus\u201d or for \u201cthem\u201d\r\n- **Social closure**\r\n> closure and differentiation tend to reinforce each other\r\n- **Political salience**\r\n> \u201cthick\u201d identities reduce the range of possible political actions; ethnic politics tends to reinforce differentiation and closure\r\n\r\n## Boundary work\r\n- The phenomenon of individuals or groups **creating, maintaining, adjusting, or breaking through** various boundaries in society, such as ethnic, cultural, social, etc., **to shape identity, group relationships, and social interactions**.\r\n- Ethnic categories may **expand or contract** (a focal topic in ethnic studies) due to boundary work.\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> _Wimmer_: People have repertoires of identities to chose from. Their choices may change when institutional incentives change. So, **repertories \u2260 situational ethnicity**.\r\n\r\n## Components of Boundary Work\r\n- **Type of boundary**\r\n> which criteria for similarity/difference (e.g., ethnicity, race, gender, nationality, generation) is highlighted in the pursue or recognition and/or political power?\r\n- **Type of strategy**\r\n> e.g., boundary crossing; normative inversion; expansion; contraction\r\n- **Location of boundary**\r\n> membership rule: what is the criterion or threshold for being one of \u201cus\u201d?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n# Pan-ethnicity, situational ethnicity, the limit of constructivism\r\n## Situational Ethnicity\r\n-  Individuals or groups actively choosing to emphasize or express a specific ethnic identity in a particular context. \r\n- This identity is determined by the current social environment, social situations, or specific contexts, and may change due to different situations.\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> Individuals or groups selectively emphasize or conceal their ethnic identity based on different social contexts to **adapt to different social needs or express a sense of belonging**. \r\n\r\n## Impacts of (activated) ethnic identification (self or other) on social interactions\r\n-  Cognitive schemes of interpretation (_Brubaker\uff1aEthnicity as Cognition_)\r\n- Affective dispositions (sometimes _hot cognition_)\r\n- Behavioral tendencies\r\n- But interactions can also generate shifts in the above _(e.g., contact theory)_\r\n\r\n## Two types of variation in ethnic identification\r\n- **Temporal** (i.e., the conditions that evoke different degrees and expressions of ethnic identification).\r\n> e.g., In certain specific social events or cultural celebrations, individuals may express their ethnic identity more strongly, while in other everyday contexts, ethnic identity may be relatively weak or less prominent.\r\n- **Cross-sectional**: hierarchies of identities (i.e., identities\u2019 relative degree of salience).\r\n> e.g., A person may emphasize their professional identity more in the workplace, while emphasizing their ethnic identity more at family gatherings.\r\n\r\n## Instrumental ethnicity\r\n- Sometimes ethnicity is used instrumentally, but that is because it has been **internalized** and is considered **primordial**. \r\n- Also, there is a difference between superficial act of signaling and deep act of adopting/embracing an identity.\r\n- The content of ethnic identity functions as a **filter** through which personal and collective goals are defined and sorted.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Managing ethnic diversity\r\n## What is a nation?\r\n### Defition: \r\n_Anderson (Imagined Communities, p.6):_ An imagined political community-and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign. \r\n### What composes this definition?\r\n- **Imagined**\r\n> Even in the smallest of all nations, a member will **never** know, meet, or event hear about most other members. However, the shared nation 'exists' in the consciousness of its members.\r\n- **Limited**\r\n> People imagined nations as **bounded**: in our minds, the world population is divided to distinct nations. Perceived criteria for national membership. There are Rules for how to join 'our' nation.\r\n- **Sovereign**\r\n> The nation is perceived by its members and outsiders who recognize its existence as sovereign or at least entitled to sovereignty. That makes the nation a **political community**: nations should **run their own business based on shared goals**.\r\n- **Community**\r\n> The nation as an extended family or fraternity: a group whose members **share an equality at a profound level**. A community of feelings, solidarity, loyalty, and sometimes sacrifice (of people who are mostly **anonymous** to each other and also **unequal** in many respects).\r\n\r\n## How are (some) of the components may be related to ethnicity and interethnic relations?\r\n- Nationhood (_sovereign_) and Nation-ness (_internal unity and cohesion_)\r\n- A community of feelings and shared fate via the cultural stuff\r\n- Ethnic mythology and symbols in the service of nationalism\r\n- Myths of origin and antiquity\r\n- A scared land via 'poetic spaces' _(e.g., archeological sites, battle fields, monuments, national map)._\r\n- Golden age, national heroes. \r\n- The collective past as a moral yardstick for evaluating the present and blueprint for the future via collective goals _(i.e., national revival)._\r\n\r\n## What is nation-state?\r\n- A **territorially bounded sovereign** polity-ie., a state - that is **ruled in the name of a community** of citizens who **identify themselves as a nation**.\r\n- A fusion of two principles: **state** sovereignty and **national** sovereignty.\r\n- Nation-state institutions nurture **national sentiments**.\r\n> For members of the nation, 'their' state (which they usually see as their homeland) is the object of love, commitment or yearning.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> This definition highlights that **the authority of governments** of nation-state is based on the **claim-made inwards** (i.e., the people) and **outwards** (i.e., the international community)-that the government rules in the name of a nation.\r\n\r\n## Solutions to the problem of incongruence of cultural and political boundaries\r\n### Reducing / eliminating diversity\uff1a\r\n- Oppression (by authoritarian regimes)\r\n- Ethnic cleansing\r\n\ufeff- Assimilation policies through centralized education and cultural institutions\r\n### Managing diversity: \r\n- Political arrangements that contain ethnic diversity and reduce conflict\r\n\r\n## Typology of Democracies\r\n- Republican liberal\r\n- Individual liberal\r\n- Consociational\r\n- Multicultural\r\n- \ufeff\ufeffEthnic democracy\r\n\r\n## Some of the challenges to inclusionary management of diversity\r\n- **Large migrations** \r\n> less assimilation + postnational incorporation (_Soysal_); resistance by host societies\r\n- **Indigenous Movements** \r\n> request greater respect and protection for their culture and rights\r\n- The rise of **neo-nationalism** \r\n> resulting in exclusion of multiculturalism, and even triggering discrimination and hostility towards specific ethnic or cultural groups\r\n- Empowerment of **populist-authoritarian leaders**\r\n> tend to emphasize nationalism and xenophobia, and hold a hostile attitude towards ethnic minorities and immigrants\r\n\r\n## What is 'postliberal' politics / citizenship?\r\n- Demanding **recognition** in cultural uniqueness of ethnic minority _(resistance to complete assimilation)_.\r\n- Claiming **collective rights** for ethnic groups _(in addition to equal/just distribution of resources)_.\r\n- Demanding **autonomy** within the state for ethnic groups in their traditional territories.\r\n- Demanding maintenance and extension of **civil rights**.\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> Citizenship allows **contradictions** between autonomy and civil rights _(e.g., patriarchal norms)_\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Ethic stratification and inequality\r\n## What is a **Social Stratification**?\r\n- **Institutionalized** inequality (including legitimizing ideology)\r\n- Inequality between **social categories**\r\n- Inequality in access to different types of **resources** _(e.g., economic, political, legal, health, etc.)_\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n>Ethnic stratification: A state of at least **partial alignment** of ethnic division and social stratification.\r\n\r\n## How does status translate into economic advantages?\r\n- Ethnic division of **labor** (monopoly over certain occupations)\r\n- **Endogamy** (marriage as an economic exchange)\r\n- **Stereotypes** (affect the judgment of employment, landlords, policemen, judges, etc.)\r\n- **Ideology** may justify alignment of status and class\r\n\r\n## Ethnic stratification via **Political Arrangements**\r\n- Ethnic stratification in **colonial and postcolonial** states\r\n- **Global stratification** (_citizenship as a resource_)\r\n> There is an unequal distribution of opportunities, privileges, and resources among individuals and groups in different countries or regions. \r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> In this context, citizenship is seen as a valuable resource that **grants individuals specific rights, protections, and benefits** based on their country of origin or nationality.\r\n\r\n- **Group discrimination** by state institutions\r\n- Differential access to certain **jobs**\r\n- Mechanisms of inclusion/exclusion of **immigrants** based on their ethnicities\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Assimilation/Integration/Segregation/Incorporation of Immigrant Ethnic minorities\r\n## _Portes and Zhou_: Three types of **Acculturation Approach**:\r\n- **Adoption** of the dominant culture and assimilation in the **middle-class**.\r\n- **Adoption** of a counter-culture and assimilation in **lower classes**.\r\n- Social and economic **mobility** through maintenance of an ethnic group's culture, values, and solidarity.\r\n\r\n## The Impact of the Context in the Receiving Country and Society\r\n- Government policy: receptive, indifferent, or hostile\r\n- Societal reception: Prejudiced or nonprejudiced\r\n- Co-ethnic community: Weak or strong\r\n\r\n## What drives certain groups to 'choose' differentiation/assimilation?\r\n- Skin color\r\n- Place of residence\r\n- Economic shifts\r\n- Capacity to utilize them though different types of capital\r\n\r\n## The long-term effects of the 'context'\r\n- **Government's assistance** to immigrants improves their children's (and their children's) mobility chances.\r\n- Sometime **negative stereotypes** persist for generations.\r\n- Immigrant's decision to join strong ethnic community may affect the **mobility of their offspring**.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Ethnic Violence\r\n## Types of ethnic violence\r\n-  Ethnic riot \r\n- Lynch  \r\n- Pogrom \r\n- Ethnocide _(of culture)_\r\n- Genocide (of people)\r\n- Inter-state wars may include an ethnic component\r\n- Civil wars\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> Some ethnic conflicts include **more than one** type of violence.\r\n\r\n## Previous reasons for collective violence\uff1a\r\n- Violence is **natural**; a human tendency that had developed through evolution.\r\n- **Socialization** to violence\r\n> (a) arguments about **failed socialization**; (b) arguments about socialization to **non-normative behavior**.\r\n- **Psychoanalytical** argument\r\n> e.g., (a) violence as **externalization of interna tensions**; (b) violence as projection of suppressed traumatic social relationships (for instance, _child-parents or child-teacher_).\r\n- **Crowd** psychology\r\n> people become violent during collective action that causes **de-individuation and extasy**\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> Classic arguments are partial explanation that point to possible roots of **people\u2019s motivation** to participate in ethnic violence, but they **cannot explain instances** of ethnic violence.\r\n\r\n## _Ted Robert Gurr_: Reasons for ethnic violence\r\n- The basis of violence is frustration (frustration-aggression theory).\r\n- Frustration stems from relative deprivation (not necessarily economic).\r\n- An ethnic group\u2019s leadership utilizes feelings of frustration and anger to mobilize them for protest and violence. Sometimes this is done as a cold-minded strategy.\r\n\r\n## Characteristics of Ethnic Riot\r\n- Brutal\r\n- Highly passionate, but with clear patterns \r\n> e.g., target selection, common order: trigger event, rumors spread, escalation, (expansion to other places), decline.\r\n- Violence as meaning for **participants**\r\n- Violence has **general and immediate causes** \r\n> distal/proximate causes\r\n> Violence reflects ethnic/racial **cleavages**, but it is not a necessary outcome of the cleavages\r\n- A process with internal dynamic\r\n- **Trigger** events often have special **symbolic meanings**\r\n- **Leaders** may provoke feelings of frustration, rage, hatred, and fear\r\n> including by employing elements of **collective memory**\r\n- **Rumors** are a key mechanism of mass mobilization for active or passive support.\r\n- **Aggressive reaction** by the rival validate negative feelings and sense of righteousness, thus propagate violence\r\n- Violence converts negative feelings to **positive feelings**\r\n> solidarity, pride, hope, even euphoria _(Tambiah: Jubilant Destruction)_\r\n\r\n## _Wimmer_: The Political Context of Violent Ethnic Conflicts\r\n- Statistical association between ethnic violence and **political competition and exclusion**\r\n> \u2013 Ethnic uprising is more common in **ethnocracies**.\r\n> \u2013 Ethnic violence (especially coup attempts) is more common when ruling is divided between the **elites** of several ethnic groups.\r\n> \u2013 Ethnic uprising and coup attempts are more common in countries where an **ethnic minority has a history of controlling** part or the entire territory. \r\n- Ethnic violence during the **collapse** of a polity \r\n> e.g., the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia. Mechanisms: political opportunity, contagion, security dilemma.\r\n- Violence during or after **elections** \r\n> e.g., Kenya 2007-8 following rumors that the elections were stolen from the Kikuyu.\r\n- Cities with **intense political competition** experience more ethnic violence\r\n\r\n## How people choose attitudes towards violence?\r\n- **Rational choice**: Expected benefits/risks\r\n> Mechanisms: Social control, policing\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> It is possible that rational choice is more typical of specific phases of conflicts (e.g., after escalation or when it gets clearer who is going to win)\r\n\r\n- **Symbolic politics**: Participation in violence is emotional and sentimental (especially hatred and rage toward the enemy).\r\n> Mechanisms: \r\n> - People\u2019s tendency to protect their group from symbolic threats or existential threats\r\n> - Elite\u2019s manipulative use of ethnic myths and symbols to provoke hatred, rage, and fear of the enemy + internal solidarity and excitement \r\n> - Symbolic politics flattens identities, creates \u201ccollective mind\u201d: identity dichotomy (us/them), stereotypical thinking (good/evil) \r\n> - Affective reactions: positive feelings about the home group and negative feelings about the enemy\r\n> - A spiral of revenge and escalation \r\n- **Institutionalized violence**: Routinization and ritualization of violence\r\n> Circumstances and Mechanisms: \r\n> - Non-violent ethnic protests deteriorates to violence\r\n> - Actors that keep the ethnic conflicts \u201cburning\u201d (some of them provoke violence during crises : politicians, religious leaders, mural painters, gangs, local media\r\n> - Many ordinary people have experience, or at least memories from past episodes of violence: they \u201cknow\u201d what their role is likely to be; they remember the solidarity and elation they felt; they may wait for an opportunity for revenge\r\n> - Therefore, the violence process looks like a ritual with clear roles and a predicted pattern of development\r\n> - In some cities, violence is expected, almost trivial\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> The three attitudes are **not mutually exclusive** and may appear as one or multiple simultaneously\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1721482279, "style": "<style>.markdown-alert{padding:0.5rem 1rem;margin-bottom:1rem;border-left:.25em solid

\r\ndeveloped in France in the 19C. century and is based on the practice of painting out of doors and spontaneously 'on the spot' rather than in a studio from sketches\r\n\r\n* Produced an unfinished look in paintings  \r\n* Reflected fleeting moments  \r\n* Painted scenes that looked fuzzy and unrefined  \r\n* Used short, quick brush strokes  \r\n* Key artists: Monet, Degas, Pissarro   \r\n  * Monet: uses **natural pastel hue**   \r\n* Motivation: create the impression of a moment (idea comes from realism), focuses on lighting  \r\n\r\n**Post Impressionism** \r\n\r\n* Artists move further away from academic naturalism (towards abstraction)  \r\n* Strong influence non-European art and culture (Japanese prints, Primitivism)  \r\n* Key Artists: Gauguin, Van Gogh  \r\n  * Expressive color  \r\n  * Painting as subjective expression: how art can evoke emotions   \r\n  * Painting as escape from anxieties of modern life  \r\n* Cezanne, Seurat  \r\n  * Geometric stability  \r\n  * Attention to form and structure  \r\n  * Seurat: manipulates color, develops pointillism \r\n\r\nGauguin, *Vision after the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel)*, 1888\r\n\r\n* Post impressionism   \r\n* Color: white and red/ impasto red dramatic   \r\n* Theosophy   \r\n* Breton women, dressed in distinctive regional costume, have just listened to a sermon based on a passage from the Bible  \r\n* Background: divided by diagonal tree trunk   \r\n* Gauguin First religious picture, wanted to give it to a church  \r\n* Churches denied lol \r\n\r\n#### 1/18 Modernism & The female Nude: Picasso's Les demoiselles d' Avigonon\r\n\r\n**Context:**   \r\n1907  \r\nHow the painting represents the relationship between the female nude and modernism  \r\nHistory of western art and the Renaissance   \r\nImmediate context in which Picasso made this painting   \r\nGeneral reception of the painting \r\n\r\nPicasso:\r\n\r\n- Known as the inventor of cubism   \r\n- Known for Guernica (anti-war painting in 1937\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Picasso skilled at naturalism, creating an image that looks lifelike   \r\n- An opportunity to think about abstraction   \r\n- Abstraction is about deconstruction of representation   \r\n- A result of specific set of choices \r\n\r\nWithin the western tradition, long history of images/ sculpture of nude figures   \r\nAt the center of Greek art was the male nude (Michelangelo\u2019s David; Antonio\u2019s Perseus)\r\n\r\n- Male figure \\- heroic   \r\n- The accurate depiction of male nude \\- highest level of artist achievement \r\n\r\nIn contrast, female nude:\r\n\r\n- Nude image of female had an erotic function   \r\n- William Hogarth, Marriagea la Mode: curtain drawn over a female nude bc it\u2019s so overly erotic   \r\n- Titles like: sleeping venus; Rokeby Venus; the Toilette of Venus (god of love) \\-\\> a mythological pretext for her nudity  \r\n- Distort female body to show more nudity  \r\n- Emerged in the context of italian renaissance that insisted upon the gap of the functions of male and female nudity \r\n\r\nEdouard Manuet \\- broke the historical tradition \r\n\r\n- Olympia, 1863 (referencing Venus of Urbino) \\- first modernist painting   \r\n  - Depicts the modern life  \r\n  - Declares the surface of painting, acknowledges the existence of the canvas   \r\n  - Frankness of her stare suggests a transactional relationship btw viewers of the painting and her  \r\n  - Flowers brought to her by a woman who\u2019s her servant (African descent) from her next client   \r\n- A hinge btw the history of reclining female nude and its modern iteration  \r\n- Deliberately updates the figure, no longer a mythological figure of Venus but explicitly a modern sex worker   \r\n- The way in which he compressed the space (compared to Venus of Urbino) \\- darkness \u2192 shallow background, brightness of white presses forward   \r\n  - Establishes a precedent of avant garde shock that happens through the female nude\r\n\r\nPaul Gauguin, Copy of Manuet\u2019s Olympia 1891\r\n\r\n- A deliberate conversation   \r\n- Modernism is worked through the body of female nude  \r\n    \r\n  Sex workers/ women, an emblem of modernism \u201cThe New Woman\u201d  \r\n- The beautiful girl 1919  \r\n- Street, berlin, 1913\r\n\r\nPaul Cezanne, The large bathers, 1906\r\n\r\n- He challenges the fundamental assumptions of naturalism  \r\n- Ex: this work depicts the real world but also presents itself as a painting through  \r\n  - The breaking open of form (the distortion of tree branches; the relationship between the trunk and the sky)\r\n\r\nMatisse paints Bonheur de vive (in conversation w the painting above)\r\n\r\n- Abstraction  \r\n- Emptying out of form  \r\n- Emphasis on outline  \r\n- Discrete scenes: idealized and pastoral   \r\n- Trying to create a modern, classical grandeur   \r\n- Pleasing to look at\r\n\r\nGertrude Stein: hangs up this painting, seen by Picasso   \r\nPicasso was in the process of painting the portrait of Gertrude Stein, saw Matisse\u2019s painting as a challenge and came up w Les Demoiselles d Avignon  \r\n\r\n- The painting of Gertrude Stein reflects his interest in form\r\n\r\n**Les Demoiselles d Avignon** (Symbolic of Picasso\u2019s misogyny and racism)  \r\nNo pastoral setting, no bright colors  \r\neverything is angular    \r\nRed light district in Barcelona (Spanish sex workers)  \r\nShallow space \u2192 compression achieved through a lack of background detail; a tangled of bodies; disproportion of faces  \r\nstylistic dysjunction (multiple styles happening in one painting)\r\n\r\n- Faces resemble \u2192 Dan mask; Baule mask \u2192 signifies Africaness/ a monstrosity\r\n\r\nFlatness of figures   \r\nPresence of a reclining figure (second on the left)\r\n\r\n- Makes more sense if she were to be lying down  \r\n- Rendering her hinged up at the viewers  \r\n- Further compresses the space, a furthering of abstraction  \r\n- What does that achieve?   \r\n  - The figure becomes confrontational   \r\n  - Gazes are multiplied (compared to Olympia), extending the dialogue  \r\n  - Olympia confronts the everyday male viewer w his own practices of sexuality and how that\u2019s comodified   \r\n  - Whereas Picasso is aiming to further the shock factor, to further highlight to the male viewers the banality of the everyday life; updates a classic genre, intentionally   \r\n    - Through the extension of flattening, the multiplication of gazes  \r\n- Figure on the very left  \r\n  - Holding open a curtain for viewers to survey her body\r\n\r\nNowhere for the eyes to go, attention gets thrown back to the foreground  \r\n(white and black are used to render volume, which the painting lacks)  \r\nThe fruit at the bottom of the canvas \r\n\r\n- Putting viewers at the table, engaging with and confronting the women directly\r\n\r\nUnderstood as a formal innovation that led to Cubism \r\n\r\nPrimitivism in 20th C.: Western writers conceive the cultural other as an authenticity, as a sight of other than themselves, rather than reflecting about the differences \r\n\r\nRinggold, Picasso\u2019s Studio\r\n\r\n- Picasso becomes a side character in the story of modernism \r\n\r\n#### 1/23 Post-Impressionism (Continue)\r\n\r\nDivisionism: reflecting on the division of plane into infinite dots  \r\nPointillism \r\n\r\n- Two directions that artists go to engage w colors (differentiation vs synthesis) \r\n\r\n###### *Georges Seurat*\r\n\r\nInterested in scientific approach to color, to bringing stability and classical quality to impressionism   \r\nAnd thinking about class in the contemporary context\r\n\r\n* Bathers at Asnieres 1884  \r\n  * Working class leisure   \r\n  * Lower class status  \r\n  * Context: Pastoral, mythological settings of traditional bather paintings   \r\n* Sunday Afternoon 1884  \r\n  * Middle class leisure   \r\n  * Mature style \u2192 more dotted    \r\n* Le chahut 1889  \r\n  * Performance as a social context, not an image of performance isolated from its context Create opportunities for a rich patterning of colors \u2192 stability of subject, contradicts the content  \r\n  * Stability vs. movement (classism, solemnity)  \r\n* Parade de cirque 1887  \r\n  * Bourgeois, leisure, at night \r\n\r\n![\u5fae\u4fe1\u622a\u56fe_20240906113348](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2824175-d518-4b8f-a4d6-aa94b722a4a3)\r\n\r\nInfluential figure for the development of cubism, not totally post impressionist bc approach looks very different from impressionist   \r\nBreaking open closed form\r\n\r\n* Still Life w Basket of apples 1893  \r\n  * Stuffy genre \u2192 still life   \r\n  * Creating a scene w multiple diff perspectives   \r\n  * Edge of table doesn\u2019t line up, the corners don\u2019t match  \r\n  * Thick application of paint for napkin: Creating a sense of structure, of folds  \r\n  * Overall composition: disorienting   \r\n    * Trying to paint in a way that reflect the way our eyes engage w paintings \u2192 not linear, not single point perspective; our eyes wander around   \r\n    * Breaking the standard criteria of composition since Renaissance which is the idea of a unified image (\u2192 painting has to present one thing from one view) \\- Deconstruction of tradition   \r\n    * Representation vs reality: how painting constructs representation   \r\n    * Interested in the materiality of color; Brush strokes: constructing forms w paint   \r\n* Mont sainte Victoire 1885  \r\n  * Disintegration of form   \r\n  * Lack of outline: truck of tree vs un outlined zone next to it  \r\n  * Recession of space, tree established a sense of distance   \r\n* Mont Sainte Victoire 1902  \r\n  * Repeated patches of color \\- pixelated \\- sit on the surface of the canvas   \r\n  * Stacked up vertically, no sense of space   \r\n  * Bleeding of forms \\- breaking open of form itself; form isn\u2019t a coherent thing, designated by outlines or not; Key principle that Cezanne is challenging   \r\n  * Analysis of representation through the materiality of painting   \r\n* The Large Bathers 1906  \r\n* Bathers 1894-1905  \r\n  * Drawing on a tradition of scenes of bathers   \r\n    * idealized natural setting, mythological context (Diana and Callisto 1635; Pastoral Symphony 1510\\)  \r\n    * Bathing: pretext for nudity   \r\n  * Cezanne and Seurat continue the tradition  \r\n    * Interest in using new techniques to engage traditional subjects \r\n\r\nImpressionists: Momentarily experience w naturalism   \r\nPost impressionist: artist capture their own experience in a subjective way \r\n\r\n- Everyone is motivated by the desire to access truth, to make a painting that feels true and real, whether its through personal temperament or objective perspective   \r\n- Idea of Expressionism is emerging \r\n\r\n###### *Chronology of Matisse & Fauvism* \r\n\r\nSalon d\u2019Automne, 1905\r\n\r\n* Key moment of Fauvism  \r\n  * Short lived movement, influential, head figure: Matisse  \r\n  * Matisse \\+ Picasso   \r\n  * Two different approach to modernism: Matisse \\- Characterized by his use of color; Picasso \\- Interested in form \r\n\r\nPaul Signac: advocate for divisionist technique, for neo impressionism \r\n\r\n* Golde Juan 1896: Experimenting w non naturalistic color   \r\n* Matisse studied with Signac

Jatte) \\- Pre Fauvist work \r\n\r\n* Both reflects neo impressionism and deviates from it   \r\n* Devisionist technique: dots bigger and elongated; Seurat would never paint in dashes   \r\n* Attention between form and color   \r\n* No relationship betweenn lifelike depiction and the color; color no longer a vessel for naturalism   \r\n* Complementary colors  \r\n* Scene of bathers, mosaic quality, sense of flatness   \r\n* Interested in classical theme but also including his own recurring model

of colors; rich variety of colors;  \r\n* different types of application of paint: Flat patchiness vs thick impasto (inconsistency)\r\n\r\nHuman figures: a divorce between the image from its need to represent the actual person (trace back to Van Gogh) \r\n\r\n* Fauvism: First avant garde movement in Paris   \r\n  * Etymology: beast in French  \r\n  * Shocking to Parisian viewers bc it was

perspective   \r\n* Flat planes of colors   \r\n* Moving away from the scientific approach to color (neo impressionism)   \r\n* Embracing a more expressive mode of color (harmonious color scheme)  \r\n* Pastoral scene; water in the background; classical motif   \r\n* Units of scenes within the painting, each existing independently  \r\n* Encourages the eye to wander around, circumnavigate the

about color, but Cubism is about form  \r\n* external material incorporated into the painting\r\n\r\nRepresentation: from likeness to signification \r\n\r\n* Rejecting the idea of what art is \u2013 it doesn\u2019t exist on a surface; it\u2019s not decorative   \r\n* Analysis of the nature of representation   \r\n  * Representation: Imitation of likeness   \r\n  * You can describe something that help viewers conjure their own image (there are non representational mode of painting)  \r\n  * From the iconic to the linguistic mode of representation  \r\n    * The signifer and the signified (the relationship is arbitrary) \r\n\r\nCollage\r\n\r\nPicasso \r\n\r\n* Move from naturalism to impressionism (date?)  \r\n* Blue Period 1902  \r\n* Rose Period 1905 (post-impressionism)  \r\n* Interest

non-naturalistic color   \r\n  * Picasso: Transformation of form   \r\n    * Conceptually more challenging than distortion of color   \r\n  * Reintegration the debate between line and color  \r\n* Continued use of Iberian mask late 1906   \r\n* Culminates in Demoiselles 1907\r\n\r\nBraque *Houses at L\u2019Estaque 1908* \r\n\r\n* What gave cubism the name   \r\n* Digesting the lessons of Picasso and Cezanne  \r\n  * Vs. *Mont Sainte Victoire* by Cezanne  \r\n  * A more limited color palette, a simplification of form   \r\n  * No sky, horizon line, creates a feeling of the form spilling forward rather than receding back   \r\n  * The shading is not working in the opposite way  \r\n    * Typically the light is closer to the audience and the shadow is further away   \r\n    * Creating the sense that the volume is concave instead of convex \r\n\r\nPicasso *Three Women* 1908\r\n\r\n* Every form is a triangle  \r\n* Less cubes than facets   \r\n* the different placement of

Midterm Concept Review: \r\n\r\n**1886-1905 Post-Impressionism**\r\n\r\n* reaction against Impressionists' concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and color  \r\n* sought to bring a more systematic approach to the structure and form of painting  \r\n* Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and Paul C\u00e9zanne all shared an interest in making art that went beyond the mere representation of the natural world, focusing instead on expressing more abstract, emotional, and spiritual concepts\r\n\r\nSynthetism (subset of Post-impressionism)\r\n\r\n* Key figure: Paul Gauguin  \r\n  * Particularly his work in Tahiti: synthesized the outward appearance of the subject matter with the artist's feelings about the subject and the aesthetics of the painting itself (does it also fall under primitivism?)  \r\n* emphasizes two-dimensional flat patterns, thus rejecting three-dimensional perspective  \r\n* Characterized by the use of bold flat forms separated by dark contours  \r\n* Using color symbolically rather than realistically \r\n\r\nNeoimpressionism (another subset of post-impressionism)\r\n\r\n* response to Impressionism: interested in applying scientific research in optics and color theory to create a more harmonious and structured form of art compared to the more spontaneous and subjective approach of the Impressionists  \r\n* Key figures: Georges Seurat and Paul Signac  \r\n* most famous for its development of Pointillism (or Divisionism), a technique involving the application of paint in small dots of pure color, which are intended to blend in the viewer's eye\r\n\r\n**1900-1908 Fauvism (transitional stage to Cubism)**\r\n\r\n* pure, brilliant colour aggressively applied straight from the paint tubes to create a sense of an explosion on the canvas  \r\n* Focus on nature (like the Impressionists)   \r\n* Key figure: Matisse  \r\n  * reject traditional renderings of three-dimensional space and to seek instead a new picture space defined by movement of colour\r\n\r\n**1908-1929 Cubism**\r\n\r\n* Key figures: Picasso, Braque   \r\n* Emphasized flat, two-dimensional surface of the picture plane   \r\n* rejecting the traditional techniques of perspective, foreshortening, modeling, and chiaroscuro  \r\n* refuting theories that art should imitate nature\r\n\r\nAnalytic Cubism (1910-1912)\r\n\r\n* While they moved away from naturalistic representation, they are very interested in the idea of representations and different modes of representation   \r\n* Breaking down, analysis of form, display the essence of an object (or the complex totality of its subject) from multiple perspectives in a single two-dimensional framework  \r\n* Picasso and Braque: simplified their colour schemes to a nearly monochromatic scale (hues of tan, brown, gray, cream, green, or blue were preferred) in order not to distract the viewer from the artist\u2019s primary interest\u2014the structure of form itself  \r\n* Semiotics: The relationship between the signifer and the signified   \r\n* What is the plane doing? move beyond the surface of the canvas rather than to recede in depth  \r\n* representational motifs: letters, musical instruments, glasses etc. \r\n\r\nSynthetic Cubism (Post 1912\\) \r\n\r\n* emphasize the combination, or synthesis, of forms in the picture  \r\n* Colour assumes a strong role in these works  \r\n* Shapes become more decorative   \r\n* Trompe l\u2019Oeil\\!\\!  \r\n  * emphasizes the differences in texture and, at the same time, poses the question of what is reality and what is illusion  \r\n* Key figures:  Fernand L\u00e9ger, Sonia Delaunay, Juan Gris, Marcel Duchamp, Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger\r\n\r\nSalon Cubism\r\n\r\n* Coined to describe the works and the artists of Cubism who exhibited in various Paris Salons  \r\n* Interested in the geometricizing of form\r\n\r\n**1905\u20131920 Expressionism**\r\n\r\n* artist seeks to depict not objective reality but rather the subjective emotions and responses that objects and events arouse within a person  \r\n* Key artists: Van Gogh, Die Br\u00fccke, Ludwig Kirchner  \r\n* artists used the expressive possibilities of colour and line to explore dramatic and emotion-laden themes, to convey the qualities of fear, horror, and the grotesque, or simply to celebrate nature with hallucinatory intensity\r\n\r\nDie Br\u00fccke 1905-1913\r\n\r\n* played a pivotal role in the development of Expressionism  \r\n* Emphasized raw, emotional expression through vivid colors and bold strokes  \r\n* founded by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner  \r\n* Wanted to defy conventions of traditional painting as well as Impressionism and Post-Impressionism  \r\n* subject matter\u2014the human figure, landscape, portraiture, still life\u2014executed in a simplified style that stressed bold outlines and strong colour planes\r\n\r\nDer Blaue Reiter 1911-1914\r\n\r\n* expressionistically oriented  \r\n* Focused on spiritual and symbolic interpretations of art, with Kandinsky as a leading member  \r\n* unlike Die Br\u00fccke, their expressionism took the form of lyrical abstraction.   \r\n* imbued their art with deep spiritual content  \r\n* influenced by the Jugendstil group, Cubism, Futurism, and \u201c**naive**\u201d folk art\r\n\r\n\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1725595143, "style":

Capitalist nihilism, however, is the valorisation process of capital value swallowing, progressively, all (cultural, normative, moral) values that are not capitalist yet. The avant-gardes' 'brave' move against morals, in this sense, was as \u201cuntimely\u201d as Nietzsche's same move a few decades earlier. The only thing left to do after this delving into cynicism was to follow a cosmologically conceived na\u00efve anarchism for which the end of self-determination equals the end of domination, since subjectivity is nothing but a disciplining function, and conscience nothing but a fatherly super-ego. Of course, such 'anarchism' must pretend that no societal infrastructure would be left after one withdrew from one's conscious, conscientious, responsive autonomy \u2013 as if desire or fantasy were somehow 'outside' of (consumerist\\!) society. Without a doubt, today's art world is dominated by this cynical version of \u201canarchism\u201d, and its hegemony mimics capital's valorising devalorisation \u2013 or capitalist nihilism.\r\n\r\n#### 3/5 Marcel Duchamp\r\n\r\n* Relate to Dada \\+ salon cubism\r\n\r\n*Nude Descending a Staircase no.2* 1912   \r\n*The Passage from Virgin to Bride* 1912  \r\n*The Bridge* 1912  \r\n*The Chocolate Grinders* 1913-1914  \r\n\u201cbased on a reaction of visual indifference, with at the same time a total absence of good or bad taste\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nReadymades \r\n\r\n* Everyday, mass-produced    \r\n* Abt painting  \r\n* The art is not the intuitive decorative expression but it\u2019s THE idea  \r\n* Conceptualism   \r\n* Using pictures to engage w text \u2013 a linguistic dimension   \r\n* Using text to re signify objects as artworks   \r\n* Paintings have lost their historical significance and have already become on one hand conceptual and on another, mechanical execution   \r\n* The comb 1916: punning of comb in french/ painting in french  \r\n  * Kant: aesthetic judgment   \r\n* After Duchamp, the question is not is this good art; the Q is is it art in the first place (good and bad doesn't matter)  \r\n* Duchamp is only an okay painter so he\u2019s finding the third option by turning the whole thing on its head  \r\n* Dadaist engagement w chance, filtered through readymades \r\n\r\nFountain 1917 \r\n\r\nTu m\u2019 1918\r\n\r\n* Stoppages  \r\n* Shadows of readymades   \r\n* Swatches of colors representing the mass produced  \r\n* Physically incorporated the readymade: the bottle brush sticking out of the canvas generating its own shadow outside the work  \r\n* A physical rip in the painting reattached w safety pins  \r\n* Didnt paint the hand himself, hired a billboard painter painted the hand  \r\n* Register of his own departure from painting in the form of a painting   \r\n* By using all these different registers   \r\n  * Naturalism   \r\n  * Physical object   \r\n  * Abstract form  \r\n* Duchamp\u2019s own thinking abt his self referientiality, his career \r\n\r\nBox in a valise \r\n\r\n* Elements of descending staircase, stoppages  \r\n* Traveling \r\n\r\nL.H.O.O.Q. 1930  \r\nL.H.O.O.Q.

It discusses the Virgilian paradox, an epic of drama and pathos that goes back to the origins of modern debate on Virgil in the Romantic period, where the supposed **natural primitivism and fresh naivete of Homer** was commonly and unfavourably contrasted with the **more artificial and sophisticated Virgilian epic**. \r\n> <br/>\r\n> It argues that Virgil too sensed from the beginning that the naturalness and noble simplicity of Homer was essentially irrecoverable in the cultural context of the first century BC, but that he had the opportunity to create a Homer for his own times. It also charts the quintessential ambiguity of the Aeneid, both reflecting the **traditionally nationalistic ideology of Roman epic in the steps of Naevius and Ennius**, and **showing an extraordinary empathy with the focalisations and feelings of individual characters**, many of whom represent a point of view at odds with the direction of the nationalistic plot.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## The death of

He sped his chariot \t\t\t\t\r\nThrough the line and told his comrades, \u201cNow stand down. \r\nPallas belongs to me. I\u2019ll go for him. \r\nI only wish his father could look on.\u201d \r\nHe spoke. His comrades quit the field as ordered. \r\nWith the Rutulians gone, the youth, transfixed \t\t\r\nBy the haughty orders, let his hard gaze rove \r\nFrom a distance over Turnus\u2019 massive form. \r\nHe gave this answer to the tyrant\u2019s words: \r\n\u201cEither\u2019s a glorious prize: a general\u2019s armor \r\nOr death. It makes no difference to my father. \t\t\r\nSo stop your threats.\u201d He stepped into the open, \r\nFreezing the blood in the Arcadians\u2019 hearts. \r\nTurnus jumped down and closed in on his prey \r\nOn foot. A lion on his lofty post \r\nSees a bull lunging on a distant plain \t\t     \t                                            \r\nAnd hurtles toward him: Turnus looked like this. \r\nPallas first gauged his spear\u2019s range, then stepped forward, \r\nCalling on the huge sky in hope that chance \r\nWould bless his bravery against the odds. \r\n\u201cHercules, come\u2014my father took you in, \t\t\t                                    \r\nA stranger\u2014help in this great enterprise. \r\nLet dying Turnus see his bloody weapons \r\nTaken from him by my victorious hands.\u201d \r\nThe god heard, but he stifled heavy groans \r\nIn his heart; the tears were futile that he shed. \t\t                                   \r\nTo comfort him, his father, Jupiter, \r\nSaid this: \u201cAn end is set for everyone, \r\nFor life is brief and cannot be recovered. \r\nBut brave men, through their exploits, strive for fame \r\nThat lasts. Beneath Troy\u2019s high walls many sons \t\t                                   \r\nOf gods died. My own child Sarpedon died there.\r\nFate calls: for Turnus too the race is ending.\u201d \r\nHe turned his eyes away from Italy\u2019s fields. \r\nPallas with all his great strength cast his spear \r\nAnd snatched his bright sword from the hollow sheath. \t                           \r\nThe spear flew, pierced the layers of the shield, \r\nAnd struck the breastplate at the shoulder\u2019s rim, \r\nFinally grazing Turnus\u2019 massive form. \r\nBut he in turn deliberately aimed \r\nHis iron-pointed pike and launched it, saying, \t\t                                   \r\n\u201cSee if my weapon is the one to stick.\r\nThe spearhead, striking, shaking, pounded through \r\nThe shield\u2014all of the bronze and iron sheets, \r\nAll of the bull-hide layers wrapping it\u2014 \r\nInto the breastplate, into that strong chest. \t\t\t                                   \r\nOut of the wound he tore the heated shaft, \r\nBut with it came his lifeblood and his soul. \r\nCollapsing forward with a crash of arms, \r\nHe touched the enemy earth with gory lips. \r\nTurnus stood over him: \t\t\t\t\t                                                  \r\n\u201cGo tell Evander this, Arcadians: \r\nI send him back the Pallas he deserves. \r\nThe soothing tribute of a burial I grant him. \r\nBut he had a costly guest\u2014 Aeneas.\u201d \r\nWith his foot he held the corpse down \t\t\t                                          \r\nAnd stripped the giant swordbelt with its story  \r\nOf crime etched in\u2014a wedding night that left \r\nThe bedrooms smeared with gore of slaughtered youths\u2014 \r\nThat Clonus, son of Eurytus, had embossed \r\nIn gold, and Turnus now was thrilled to loot. \t\t\t                         \r\nPeople know nothing of their fated future. \r\nTheir exaltation cannot stay in bounds. \r\nThe time would come when he\u2019d give anything \r\nNot to have touched the boy. He\u2019d hate his plunder, \r\nAnd hate this day. Pallas\u2019 friends pressed in, wailing. \t                                 \r\nThey laid him on his shield to haul away.\r\nWhat grief, what glory you will take your father! \r\nA single day brought war and death to you. \r\nBut see the heaps of enemy dead you leave.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n### _Bibliography_\r\n\r\nThe most relevant piece for our session is Ch. 1 of [Barchiesi 2015](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvkc7) (on JSTOR) \u2018THE DEATH OF PALLAS.
