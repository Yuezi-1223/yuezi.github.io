## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Project background
The flourishing international market has seen the rapid development of online games. As a new and powerful literary form, game culture has garnered increasing academic and public attention. Consequently, high-quality localisation and translation have become increasingly significant in order to meet the demands of a diverse global audience. In this context, the practice of localising interactive media has garnered significant attention due to its unique complexity. Game localisation is not confined to linguistic conversion. It must also handle the intertwining of multiple modes, including visual design, audio, and user interaction. Broadly speaking, game localisation refers to the process of adapting a game for players in a target country, including content and functional adjustments made to comply with local laws and market environments (Swalwell, 2021:1-15). More narrowly, it primarily focuses on the translation of in-game text, characters, plot, and scenes. The fundamental goal is to overcome a product’s inherent linguistic and cultural barriers, making the game more suitable for local players’ habits, language environment, and cognitive levels, thereby expanding the player base and increasing revenue. Consequently, game localisation is a complex, interdisciplinary process that not only involves language translation but also requires consideration of multiple dimensions, such as cultural norms, legal regulations, and technical backgrounds.
In recent years, game streaming has emerged as a rapidly growing segment of the interactive entertainment industry, attracting an expansive and diverse audience. The overall live streaming market in China has seen rapid expansion, driven by the increasing popularity of platforms like Douyin (TikTok) and Bilibili, which have surpassed more traditional, dedicated game-streaming sites in popularity. In 2024, the number of game live-stream viewers in China reached 266 million (Vyas, 2025:1). Therefore, many game developers and publishers collaborate with popular streamers, recording their gameplay sessions, editing the content into highlight reels, and distributing these videos across online streaming platforms in order to showcase the game’s appeal and broaden its player base, which has become a key marketing strategy for game developers. Consequently, the demand for live-stream subtitles has increased significantly.
However, the shift in audience to prospective consumers instead of players, along with the change in medium to promotional content instead of immersive gameplay, alters the fundamental purpose when translating live-stream subtitles compared to in-game text localisation. What’s more, the unique technical constraints inherent to the subtitle format itself further necessitate distinct translation strategies since subtitling is governed by strict spatiotemporal limitations: the text must synchronize precisely with audio and visual cues, remain on screen for a limited duration, and conform to character limits per line, which often leads to different translation strategies.

### 1.2 Significance of the project
This study is particularly significant as it addresses a notable gap in Chinese academic research on the localisation of real-time streaming games. While the field of game localisation has gained attention, this specific area of comparative study between localisation and subtitles remains largely unexplored. Therefore, the present project aims to: (1) compare both shared and different translation strategies for in-game text and live-stream subtitles; (2) explain divergences in readership and strategy through Skopos theory and multimodal translation theory; and (3) offer a theoretical framework and practical recommendations for translators and localisers working in multimodal contexts.

### 1.3 Structure of the report
This dissertation is structured into five chapters, mainly comparing translation strategies for in-game text and live-stream subtitles.
Chapter 1 introduces the research background, aims, and methodology. Chapter 2 reviews relevant translation theories, specifically Skopos Theory, and provides an analysis of the source text types. Chapter 3 delves into the Skopos Theory framework, analysing the distinct target audiences and communicative purposes for in-game text and live-stream subtitles. Chapter 4 presents a comparative analysis through specific case studies, highlighting shared and differing translation strategies such as explicitation, simplification, and dynamic variations. Chapter 5 summarises the key findings, emphasising the guiding role of Skopos Theory in game localisation and offering insights into the industry, such as the need for context-aware translation tools and the proactive role of the translator in the process. 

## Chapter 2: Preparation of Translation
The translator’s preparation for translation commonly decides the quality of translation. An optimal translation program contains “background preparation” and “actual processes”, and there are four fundamental stages in the process of translation: analysing the source text, translating source text into target text, reorganizing the target language and testing the translated text (Nida, 2001:21).
Regarding background preparation, the author engaged in a series of preparatory steps to ensure both linguistic accuracy and functional adequacy. These included background research into the historical and cultural context of the game, a comprehensive reading of the full English script to gain familiarity with its narrative flow and stylistic features, and the adoption of the developer-provided CAT tool to manage the technical aspects of localisation. Together, these measures established a solid foundation for the translation process, combining cultural knowledge, textual analysis, and technical competence.

### 2.1 About the game
_The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ is an adventure game developed by the British game studio, Afoot Games, and was released on the Steam platform on 26 March 2025. This game is adapted from Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective novel series, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Set in a cosy Sussex village called Fulworth during the early 20th century, the game depicts Sherlock Holmes in his retirement as a beekeeper, attempting to organise a clifftop picnic for Dr. John H Watson. In the process of preparing for the event, he encounters a series of unexpected local mysteries, which he must resolve using his intellect and with the assistance of his friends in the village. The whole story is made up of three main mysteries, which involves the case of a missing cat, the disappearance of a village fete judge, and a con artist who claims to have found a mermaid fossil on the beach. As players explore the game, they can talk to specific characters or investigate details in the scenes to unlock new dialogues and backstories. 
_The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ features its emphasis on exploration, dialogue, and player choice. The game has twelve fully voice-acted characters, which includes both familiar faces from the original stories and brand-new original characters. Players can interact with iconic figures like Sherlock Holmes’s loyal partner, John Watson, as well as a new cast of characters such as a clown with a tragic past, a budding young naturalist, a devoted fan of Holmes, a cunning fraudster and so on. Through a point-and-click interface, players can gather clues through examination, interact with various objects and characters, and solve puzzles that frequently offer multiple solutions by combining the findings. Also, players can move through the plot at their own pace, and as they solve these mysteries, they can also collect the items needed for the picnic in order to complete the final task and unlock the ending. In conclusion, the game’s reliance on extensive conversation and its deeply embedded cultural context makes it an ideal subject for a comparative analysis of translation strategies. 

### 2.2 Localisation software
In terms of actual translation practice, the translator relied on the developer-provided computer-assisted translation tool AGS Translation Editor (see Figure 1). This specialised software is designed to parse files generated by the Adventure Game Studio (AGS) engine, automatically extracting the in-game text into .tra files. These texts are then displayed in sequence in the main interface according to the original coding order. By referencing the source text in the left-hand column and inputting the target text in the right-hand column, the translator can export the translated content as a .trs file. This file type can be directly re-imported into the game, thereby integrating the translation smoothly into the software environment and significantly facilitating the localisation process.

### 2.3 Analysis of the Source Text
Given the multimodal and interactive nature of video games, the textual material they contain is highly heterogeneous. A clear categorisation of text types is therefore necessary to reveal how different functional roles and semiotic constraints shape translation strategies. 

#### 2.3.1 UI-related segments
Segments related to user interface (UI) constitute one of the most technical and function-oriented categories of in-game text. In _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_, dynamic prompts are the most representative example of this category. Within the game, players can perform four actions: “Pick Up”, “Examine”, “Use”, and “Converse”. Before the player confirms an action, a line of white text appears at the bottom of the screen, showing the action and the object of interaction (see Figure 2). In the code for this dynamic prompt, the object of interaction is set as a variable, which will change according to the player’s selection. Therefore, UI-related segments carry specific technical constraints because the variables are directly integrated into the game’s code. Translators must first ensure that the variable references and formatting remain intact so that the game engine can correctly display the dynamic prompts.

#### 2.3.2 Dialogues in the non-interactive cutscene
Cutscenes are non-interactive animations in which the player becomes only a viewer rather than an active participant. In _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_, cutscenes are heavily dialogue-driven and function as key narrative vehicles. They closely resemble audiovisual translation contexts such as film or television drama, in that speech, tone, and timing must be synchronised with visual and auditory cues. The translation of cutscene dialogue must therefore balance narrative fidelity with subtitling constraints, including spatial limits and temporal synchronisation. In this sense, the localisation of cutscenes in games is similar to audiovisual translation.

#### 2.3.3 Interaction with NPCs
Conversational exchanges with non-playable characters (NPCs) are central to the game’s progression. Unlike cutscenes, these dialogues are triggered by player actions. They are interactive in nature, providing players with immediate feedback. Translating NPC dialogues requires particular attention to consistency in characterisation, register, and tone, since these conversations not only deliver plot information but also contribute to world-building and player immersion. The interactive quality of NPC dialogues also implies that their localisation must anticipate multiple potential pathways, maintaining coherence across divergent branches.

#### 2.3.4 Interaction with objects
Another significant category consists of object-related interactions, whereby players inspect, manipulate, or combine items within the game space. These texts are typically short, descriptive, and functional, but they often carry narrative weight by revealing clues, unlocking further interactions, or contributing to puzzle-solving mechanics. From a translational perspective, the challenge lies in maintaining both clarity and conciseness. The target text must provide sufficient guidance without overtly undermining the immersive experience of the game itself. Furthermore, object interactions frequently involve multimodal interplay between text, visual design, and player agency, requiring translations that align seamlessly with the game’s mechanics and semiotic resources.

#### 2.3.5 Dialogues with specific cultural or historical background
The game also includes dialogues imbued with distinct cultural and historical references, particularly those related to late Victorian and Edwardian England. Such dialogues draw upon intertextual allusions, social registers, and historically embedded practices that may be unfamiliar to target audiences. For example, references to Sherlockian lore, British institutions, or early 20th century material culture pose challenges of cultural transference. This category highlights the tension between cultural authenticity and accessibility, positioning translation as a negotiation between historical fidelity and target readership comprehension.

#### 2.3.6 Special texts which are not included in the in-game text
Finally, the game includes a special category of text not embedded within the gameplay narrative or UI, such as the interlude lyrics. While not functional in a direct sense, their inclusion is a deliberate choice, intended to serve a specific expressive purpose. These songs are intentionally chosen because their lyrics are tightly interwoven with the plot, subtly reinforcing the narrative’s themes, foreshadowing upcoming events, or providing insight into a character’s emotional state. Their primary function is to deepen the player’s emotional engagement and enrich their understanding of the story beyond the main dialogue. In the process of translating song lyrics, particular attention must also be paid to preserving the original rhythm and aesthetic qualities as far as possible. 

### 2.4 Characteristics of In-Game Text and Live-Stream Subtitles
In-game text mainly appears in dialogue boxes (see Figure 3). These allow relative flexibility in restructuring language: translators can freely adjust word order, split or merge sentences, and occasionally add interpretive details as long as spatial constraints are respected. The pace of interaction is player-controlled, enabling more flexibility in stylistic and linguistic adaptation.
Live-stream subtitles are time-bound and must synchronize with the spoken audio and visual rhythm of the stream. The subtitle format imposes strict temporal and spatial constraints, requiring brevity, legibility, and alignment with oral delivery (see Figure 3). However, subtitles also offer access to the spoken context and intonation, enabling the translator to clarify or expand upon cultural elements through informative paraphrasing without disrupting user experience.

### 2.5 Project workflow
The workflow for this project was divided into two main tasks. The first stage involved the translation of the in-game text using the AGS Translation Editor. A total of 52,584 words were processed, including dialogues, UI-related segments, and texts within the game scenes or images. 
The second stage focused on the production of Chinese subtitles for a three-hour live stream video provided by the developer which showcases a portion of the plot and gameplay. Since the video content was identical to the in-game material, the subtitles were largely based on the previous translations of in-game texts which was produced in the first stage. However, in order to meet the requirements of subtitling conventions and the specific guidelines set for Chinese subtitles, necessary modifications were made to the final target texts. These included adjustments for timing, line breaks, and readability, as well as occasional annotations to aid comprehension for specific audience.


## Chapter 3: Theoretical Framework
### 3.1 Key concepts of the Skopos theory
Skopos theory developed in Germany in the 1970s and was first put forward by scholar Vermeer. “Skopos” comes from Greek, meaning “purpose”, and the term usually refers to the “communication purpose” of the target language text. As stated by Vermeer, the purpose of translation determines every action of` translation, which indicates that the purpose determines the method. 
Vermeer exercises the concept of “purpose” into translation process, pointing out that translation is a purposeful intercultural communication (activity), highlighting the decisive role of “purpose” for the entire translation practice, and advocating that the translation method is determined by the purpose of translation.
Skopos theory highlights that the translator should centre on the aimed purpose of the translation and choose translation methods in accordance with this purpose. However, the purpose of the translation determines the method or strategy. During translation, the translator must follow three main principles: Skopos rule, coherence rule and fidelity rule.
Skopos rule features core rule of Skopos theory, including the purpose of the translator, the communicative purpose of the translation, and the purpose to be completed by using certain methods. The fact that “'method is determined by result' means that the purpose determines the entire translation practice. Guided by the Skopos rule, the translator chooses corresponding translation strategies and methods to adaptably cope with the difference between the source text and the target text, which helps the target language players have a better comprehension (Chen, 2016: 89-90). In a general sense, “purpose” indicates the communicative function of the translation on the target readers in the socio-cultural context of the target language (Venuti, 2001:13). Consequently, translators initially need to comprehend the translation context and the purpose of the text before translating, and then adopt equivalent translation method based on the translation purpose.
Coherence rule means that the translation must be intra-textual coherence, and the translation must be comprehensible and appropriate. The target language readers can understand the translation, and the translation has actual meaning in both social and cultural context of the target language. The translation will not be misunderstood by target readers due to the lack of information and obstacles. A communicative interaction can only be regarded as a success if the receivers interpret it as being sufficiently coherent with their situation (Nord, 2001:32).
Fidelity rule puts forward that there must be inter-textual coherence between the source text and the target text (Munday, 2010:128). The target text must be faithful to the source text. The purpose of the translation and the translator's understanding of the source text reveal the translation’s faithfulness to the target text (R. Xu & H. Xu, 2018: 103-105). 
Among the three rules of Skopos theory, Skopos rule is the uppermost one. Fidelity rule is subsidiary to the coherence rule. At the same time, both coherence rule and fidelity rule are premised on the Skopos rule.

### 3.2 Practice under the guidance of Skopos theory
In the case of in-game text, the Skopos is to sustain immersion and ensure functional adequacy for the player. The player, conceptualised as a player-as-reader, is an active participant who advances the narrative and directly triggers the appearance of text segments through their actions. For this audience, the translation must remain unobtrusive and natural, reinforcing the illusion of direct engagement with the fictional world. Over-explanation or redundant information would undermine coherence and disrupt the immersive effect. The coherence rule here demands that the translated text integrates seamlessly into the gameplay context, while fidelity to the source is only relevant insofar as it supports this overriding purpose.
By contrast, live-stream subtitles serve a markedly different communicative purpose. Their audience extends beyond active players to include spectators and potential consumers, many of whom may have little or no prior knowledge of the game’s mechanics. The Skopos in this context is accessibility and immediate comprehensibility. Subtitles must therefore be intelligible without reliance on player interaction or contextual cues, and may legitimately employ explicitation or minor adaptation to achieve communicative efficiency. Here, the coherence rule requires that the translation aligns with the expectations and viewing conditions of a heterogeneous audience, while the fidelity rule is subordinated to the goal of maximising comprehension and sustaining attention.

### 3.3 Analysis of the target readers
From the perspective of Skopos Theory, the decisive factor shaping translational action is the orientation towards the target reader (Vermeer, 2000:18). Although the in-game text and live-stream subtitles of _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ derive from the same source material, they are designed for markedly different readerships, which results in distinct functional objectives and, consequently, divergent translational strategies.
The in-game text is primarily directed towards an audience of Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts and established fans of detective fiction, since they need to buy the game before enjoying the content. This readership is assumed to possess a certain degree of cultural literacy regarding late Victorian and Edwardian settings, as well as intertextual references to the Sherlockian canon. For such an audience, translations must ensure their sense of immersion without drawing attention by excessive interference. In this context, the coherence rule requires smooth, unobtrusive texts that integrate seamlessly with gameplay, while fidelity to the source is valued insofar as it reinforces narrative consistency and character authenticity. Excessive explanation or intrusive annotation would disrupt the immersive experience and risk alienating the fan community.
By contrast, the live-stream subtitles target a more heterogeneous and often non-specialist audience. Many viewers are casual spectators with little prior knowledge of Holmesian lore or the cultural specificities of nineteenth-century Britain. The Skopos here shifts from immersion to accessibility and promotion. Subtitles are expected not only to render the narrative intelligible but also to stimulate interest in the game as a cultural product. To achieve this, the translator may resort to explicitation, additional annotation, or the amplification of metaphorical expressions that might otherwise remain opaque to non-fans. In this way, subtitles function as a mediating tool that lowers the barrier to entry and, in line with their promotional function, encourages wider audience engagement.
In sum, although both modalities share the general purpose of making the narrative accessible, their differing target readers necessitate divergent strategies. The in-game text privileges immersion for a knowledgeable fanbase, whereas live-stream subtitles prioritise clarity and appeal for broader audiences. Skopos theory provides a principled framework for explaining this divergence by situating translation decisions within the communicative needs of their respective readerships.

## Chapter 4: Case Study (English-Chinese part)
Building on the typological and theoretical groundwork established in the previous chapter, this section turns to a detailed case study of selected source texts from _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_. The analysis focuses on how the same textual material is localised under both in-game text and live-stream subtitles, and how their respective Skopos and text types guide the practice of translation. 
The discussion is organised into two parts. The first examines shared strategies, i.e. those approaches that operate across both modalities regardless of medium, reflecting common functional requirements such as maintaining narrative coherence or ensuring linguistic naturalness. The second investigates differentiated strategies, where divergences arise due to variations in communicative purpose and target readership. 

### 4.1 Shared strategies of translating in-game texts and live-stream subtitles
#### 4.1.1 Explicitation of logical connectives
The Chinese language is characterised as a language of parataxis. Chinese tends to use a series of relatively short, independent clauses placed in sequence to form a sentence or a text. This feature renders the connections within Chinese texts more organic and flexible, which means that Chinese readers rely more heavily on context to understand the logical relationships between sentences (Li, 2025:9). Consequently, adding logical connectives that are implicit in the source text can enhance the coherence of the target text during translation. This approach not only aligns more closely with Chinese expressive and reading conventions but also ensures greater fluency and naturalness in the translated text. Through the translation strategy of explicitation of connectives, the cognitive load for both game players and live-stream viewers can be reduced. 
The following paragraphs provide a detailed analysis of an example in my practice. 

<img width='1353' height='486' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02b1ea16-be89-407c-87c9-bb0e0df8e7f0' />

In example 1 (see Table 1), an NPC named Ruffles were talking about his tragic experiences with Holmes in the World War I. In the source text, the first sentence states the fact that Ruffles’s eye was injured, while the second sentence describes the treatment he received at the hospital and the positive outcome. The shift in emotion is only implicitly conveyed by the context in the source text. Therefore, by adding “幸运的是” (fortunately) in the target text, this turning point and emotional shift are made explicit to the audience. This allows both the players and viewers to immediately feel the change from misfortune to good luck without having to infer the logical connection, which not only aligns with the language habits of the target audience but also improves the text’s fluency and narrative pace, in line with the functional approach emphasised by Skopos Theory. 
More importantly, the addition of this logical connective also resonates with the visual elements in the game and the live-stream. As shown in Figure 4, when delivering the first line, Ruffles closes his eyes with a deeply sorrowful expression, reflecting his inner pain. However, his expression turns to one of relief in the second sentence. By explicating the logical relation between the two sentences, the translation allows the dialogue to interact harmoniously with the visual cues on the screen, thereby enhancing the sense of immersion for both players and viewers.

_Figure 4: Screenshot of example 1_

In addition, the translation of the first sentence is also adapted in light of the visual cues. From Ruffles’s portrait in Figure 4, it is evident that he wears an eyepatch over his left eye, confirming that “one eye gone” in the original refers specifically to his left eye. A literal rendering such as “一只眼睛失明，另一只眼睛角膜受损” (one eye is blind, and the other eye’s cornea is damaged) would sound redundant in Chinese. Instead, drawing on the visual information to translate them directly as “左眼彻底失明” (my left eye is completely blind) and “右眼角膜受损” (my right eye’s cornea is damaged) enables the audience to process the plot more quickly and smoothly. 

#### 4.1.2 Explicitation of semantic information
Similarly, explicating semantic information explicit in the original text can also clarify meanings that would otherwise rely on context or inference, thereby serving the shared purpose of enhancing immersion. 

<img width='1368' height='647' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfd5b840-295c-4103-8d93-e3e0e5b2aa48' />

Example 2 (see Table 2) presents a dialogue in which Holmes notices Watson reading a mystery novel. As Watson is also writing biographies of Holmes’s cases which can also be classified as mystery novel, Holmes assumes that Watson’s purpose in reading this book is to “familiarise with his competition.” However, a literal translation of this phrase into Chinese such as “熟悉你的比赛” would not only sound unnatural but would also create obstacles to readers’ comprehension. Therefore, in the translation of Holmes’s question, his semantic information is made explicit by adding the clue of “作家同行” (fellow writer) in order to convey the underlying intent of Holmes’s question more clearly.
Then in Watson’s reply, the translation renders “little story” as “推理小说” (mystery novel) further explicating the central topic of the dialogue and clarifying the implication of Holmes’s question, thereby facilitating the reader’s comprehension of the plot development. Moreover, since the previous sentence is a question, the Chinese translation chooses to add a direct response “没有” (no), which strengthens the coherence between the dialogues and ensures greater logical fluency.
In conclusion, this translation ensures that the dialogue remains coherent and readily accessible to the target audience. Adapting the wording to make implicit relations explicit and to enhance logical flow serves the communicative function of the translation, prioritising audience understanding and narrative continuity over literal fidelity to the source text.

#### 4.1.3 Contextual adaptation

<img width='1322' height='804' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5633ea2-8560-4172-9767-652c9c7cb930' />

Example 3 (see Table 3) presents a quarrel between Holmes and a fraudster. In the previous plot, Holmes, by examining Pippi’s so-called “mermaid”, discovered evidence of forgery and deduced that it had been fabricated by stitching together the specimens of a monkey and a fish. Holmes hoped to restore peace to the beach occupied by crowds drawn by Pippi and her mermaid, but her refusal to listen or to leave gradually provoked his anger during their conversation. The emotional shift between the two characters is conveyed through the game’s voice acting, so the dialogue itself should correspond to this change of feeling to enhance immersion. In the source text, their dialogues are almost identical, relying only on slight changes in sentence length and punctuation to suggest a progression of tone. A literal reproduction of this repetition in Chinese would appear rigid and unnatural, lacking the sense of authentic dialogue.
Therefore, in my translation, each line is adapted according to the narrative context. For example, Pippi’s the response “没有就是没有” (I told you didn’t) reinforces her persistence and growing impatience; and her third, “才没有呢!” (I certainly didn’t!) is more colloquial and emotionally charged, showing her outburst. This gradual variation aligns with Chinese colloquial expressions. At the same time, for Holmes’s line is also adapted entirely. The original “Indeed you did” is translated as “证据确凿” (The evidence is conclusive), which can resonate with the preceding scene in which Holmes investigates Pippi’s “mermaid and uncovers evidence of forgery, reinforcing his identity as a detective. And “You did!” was translated as “你撒谎!” to avoid repetition and enhance dramatic tension. 
From the perspective of Skopos Theory, this approach fulfils the communicative purpose of the translation by enhancing linguistic naturalness, highlighting characterisation, and supporting narrative development. 

### 4.2 Different strategies of translating in-game texts and live-stream subtitles
#### 4.2.1 Simplification in subtitles
When comparing in-game text with live-stream subtitles, one of the most obvious differences lies in the restrictions imposed on subtitles by time and space. Subtitles must appear on screen in synchrony with spoken audio, remain visible long enough to be read comfortably, and occupy limited screen space without obscuring key visual elements. Therefore, subtitles must prioritise brevity, legibility, and rhythmical alignment with oral delivery. This means that subtitles need to selectively omit content unrelated to the plot itself to maintain the greatest possible conciseness, which ensures smooth processing and uninterrupted immersion for video viewers.

<img width='1302' height='927' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b491a34d-f6f1-4a52-9af2-ffb324b687e3' />

Example 4 is a prompt triggered when the player interacts with the telephone during the investigation stage. In _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_, in order to prevent players from feeling uncertain about how to advance the storyline and to enhance the smoothness of gameplay, the developer introduced a special function that allows Holmes to contact his brother Mycroft through the telephone in the scene and seek his advice. Mycroft’s suggestions change dynamically according to the player’s progress in the game.
Within the game itself, such prompt plays a crucial functional role because it can indicate possible actions for players to avoid causing confusion. According to Skopos Theory, the communicative purpose of in-game translation is therefore not only to preserve narrative fidelity but also to maintain the usability and playability of the product. For this reason, prompts and operational instructions must be retained to fulfil their purpose.
By contrast, in the context of live-stream subtitles, the audience assumes a very different role. Viewers are not participants in gameplay, and thus do not require operational guidance. The Skopos of the subtitle text is to provide an accessible narrative experience, highlighting plot development rather than procedural accuracy. Accordingly, the translator can omit such prompts if necessary. This reduction serves two functions. First, it can avoid distracting the audience with information irrelevant to their experience. Second, it will lower the reading burden by reducing the volume of subtitle text, thereby preserving immersion in the unfolding story.
In the in-game text of example 4, in order to emphasize the location and function of this telephone, the source text in game specifically highlights “use the telephone” and “when I’m at loss.” In the localisation practice, both elements are retained in order to fulfil their functional purpose. However, in the case of subtitles, such information is unnecessary for the viewers. So these parts are intentionally omitted so as to preserve the brevity of the subtitles.

#### 4.2.2 Dynamic variation
In some cases, the dialogues triggered by different in-game interactions are the same. As a result, the in-game translation can only provide a general translation since in programming, one dialogue code can only correspond to one string of text. By contrast, subtitles for live-streams are not bound by this technical limitation. The translator can therefore adapt the same source text in different ways according to the surrounding context and narrative situation, producing variation that feels more natural and expressive. 

<img width='1317' height='1205' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecfbd780-f00d-45af-bd99-562fbf05345e' />

Example 5 (see Table 5) appears in the investigation stage at Baker Street. When the player attempts to “converse” with irrelevant items, such as slippers, paintings, or the carpet, Watson would ask whether he is “slightly bored.” Therefore, the same dialogue can be repeatedly triggered in a short span of time within the same scene, and the same dialogue was likewise repeated within less than five minutes in the live-stream. Although the in-game text cannot be altered, the subtitles allow for greater flexibility. To avoid repetition, when the line appeared a second time, I chose to rendered Watson’s question into “are you sure you’re all right”, which both prevented redundancy and subtly suggested a progression in Watson’s emotional state, conveying greater concern the second time he posed the question to Holmes.

<img width='1320' height='513' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cc0a7b6-9a28-4f4c-8b76-589e27a22833' />

Similarly, in Example 6 (see Table 6), the live-stream subtitles were adapted in order to create variation between the two identical dialogues and to allow them to integrate more smoothly into the narrative. In the live-stream, the first time Holmes calls the dog Toby it is to take him to the crime scene, while the second time it is to send him home. Accordingly, I adapted the translation in line with the corresponding context.
In conclusion, the Skopos of subtitles is enhancing narrative flow and immersion for viewers, so dynamic variation has the ability to reflect the psychological activities of a character under different contextual situation. Through reducing redundancy, aligning the language more closely with natural conversational patterns, the subtitles can ultimately offer the audience a smoother and more engaging viewing experience.

#### 4.2.3 Adding annotations in subtitles
_The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ is a game adapted from the Sherlock Holmes series, and therefore some dialogues involve direct references or creative adaptations of the canon. As discussed in Chapter 3, the target readers of the game are mainly those who already possess familiarity with the relevant cultural background. however, the live-stream is intended as a form of promotion, meaning that a significant proportion of its target readers may lack relevant knowledge. Without appropriate explanation, viewers of the live-stream videos may feel confused by the plot and be unable to appreciate the humour in the source text, thereby undermining the purpose of attracting a wider audience. 
Since only subtitles can have annotations added, the example below shows only the translation of live-stream subtitles and the corresponding annotation.

In Example 7 (See Table 7), Holmes is talking to an NPC named “Ruffles.” Because the pronunciation of “Raffles” and “Ruffles” is similar, Holmes mistakenly assumes that this NPC is a relative of Raffles the cricketer. To understand the humour underlying this exchange, it is necessary to be aware of a specific cultural background that Raffles was a criminal character created by Conan Doyle’s brother-in-law, who took inspiration from Holmes himself. Since Holmes is a detective who pursues criminals, he ironically remarks that they are “in the same circle.” To assist the audience of live-stream in grasping this allusion, a brief but essential annotation is added to the top right of the screen (see Figure 5), which not only supports comprehension of the scene but also enables interested viewers to seek out further information and expand their knowledge.

<img width='398' height='223' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0af91934-bf8c-42b5-a644-4812d9567421' />

_Figure 5: Screenshot of example 7_

Annotations can contribute to the Skopos of the live-stream by attracting and engaging a wider audience by making the content accessible. However, the coherence rule of Skopos Theory also requires that the translation be easily processable for the target audience. If annotations are overly long or with relevant information, they risk imposing a cognitive burden on viewers, distracting them from the dialogues and plots. For this reason, annotations must remain concise, offering only the essential cultural or contextual information. 

#### 4.2.4 Synchronisation of subtitles
Subtitles are required to remain closely synchronised with the accompanying audio, as they must appear and disappear in tandem with the spoken dialogue. This temporal constraint means that long or complex sentences in the source text cannot always be transferred directly into the target text without risking a mismatch between reading time and speech rhythm. To address this, translators often reformulate or restructure longer sentences in line with the pauses and intonation patterns of the voice acting. Such adaptation not only maintains synchrony but also ensures that the subtitles can be read comfortably within the limited time available, thereby preserving both comprehensibility and immersion for the audience.

<img width='1299' height='999' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adf44f5f-0519-4bbb-9c30-ff5266968919' />

In example 8 (see Table 8), Holmes makes an impossible request of his housekeeper Martha, which makes her quite agitated. To convey her impatience and anger, the in-game voice acting is delivered at a very rapid pace with only one pauses after “drop everything”. So, the subtitles not only should the wording be reduced in length to accommodate the speed of delivery, but the frequency of punctuation-based segmentation also needs to be minimised. By doing so, the rhythm of the subtitles can better align with the rapid speech, thereby reinforcing the emotional intensity of the scene. 
In this example, the source text contains multiple clauses joined in sequence, reflecting Martha’s frustration at Holmes’s unreasonable demand. If translated literally into Chinese, the subtitles would be too lengthy for comfortable reading within the limited time available on screen, and the frequent pauses marked by commas in English would make synchronisation with the rapid delivery of the voice acting difficult. Therefore, the multiple procedural steps of “drop everything, go to the shops, acquire additional food” are adapted into a metaphorical expression “就算我是魔法师” (even if I were a magician), which conveys impossibility in a more vivid and simple way. This strategy not only shortens the subtitle to suit the fast-paced delivery but also successfully recreates the pauses in the source text, thereby better matching the rhythm of the audio performance. At the same time, the figurative phrasing intensifies Martha’s emotional state by highlighting her exasperation in a culturally natural and emphatic manner.

#### 4.2.5 Audience-oriented adaptations
The same source text may yield different translations in the contexts of in-game dialogue and live-stream subtitles because of the distinct functions and communicative environments of the two media. In-game text is closely tied to interactivity: it must respond to player actions, provide operational clarity, and maintain immersion within the flow of gameplay. Subtitles, by contrast, are designed for a viewing audience who are not active participants but observers. Therefore, when translating subtitles, it is often necessary to explain and supplement the conditions and objects that trigger the dialogue. As a result, the Skopos of each medium diverges, and this divergence naturally leads to variation in translation strategies. What appears redundant or distracting in a subtitle may be essential in the game, and what is immersive in gameplay may be confusing for viewers without contextual cues. So, recognising these differing communicative purposes of their audience is crucial to understanding why identical source text is rendered differently across the two media.

<img width='1305' height='590' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd13a4d5-3265-4c96-bd64-c191b3d52748' />

In example 9 (see Table 9), the same source text is translated differently in the game and in the live-stream subtitles. After Watson’s leg injury, if Holmes interacts with his leg by pressing the “Examine” button, this dialogue will be triggered.
In the in-game localisation, Waston’s first sentence is simplified as “别动” (Stop). This is because the players are directly engaged in the interaction that triggers this response, and they are already aware of what action has been performed. Thus, the translation does not need to repeat or clarify the content of interaction. A shorter and more direct form such as “别动” can reinforce immediacy, and strengthens immersion by aligning with the player’s embodied experience.
In contrast, the live-stream audience does not share the player’s interactive perspective and may not immediately understand why Watson suddenly protests if they didn’t notice the previous action in the video. To avoid potential confusion, the subtitles choose to make the object explicit by specifying both the object and the content of this action, and translated it as “别折腾我的腿了” (stop messing with my leg). By pointing out “the leg,” the subtitles provide viewers with sufficient information to grasp the cause of Watson’s reaction, thereby ensuring narrative clarity.
Audience-oriented adaptations highlight the principle that the same line of source text may require divergent treatments depending on the audience’s role and perspective. In-game text prioritises immersion and logical coherence within interactive gameplay, while live-stream subtitles prioritise accessibility and comprehension for non-participatory viewers. Their divergent Skopos therefore demonstrate the translator’s ability to align with the communicative purpose of each medium.


## Chapter 5: Conclusion and Insights
Through the translation practice of _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_, the translator has learned and accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience about the process of game localisation and subtitling. What’s more, the translator have also identified some issues that both industry professionals and game developers often overlook, which may impact localisation quality.
### 5.1 Conclusion
This report has explored the distinctive challenges and strategies involved in translating _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ across two different media: in-game text and live-stream subtitles. 
Through practice and analysis, it can be found that Skopos Theory plays a guiding role in video game localisation. The game itself is a purposeful communicative behaviour. Different types of games have different purposes, and different types of text in a game also have different functions and purposes (Fang, 2016:103-108). Therefore, when translating video games, it is necessary to help players from different cultural backgrounds have the same game experience by following three rules of Skopos Theory. Only by meeting players’ demands and expectations for the game text can a game be recognised by target players and succeed in the international market.
The comparison between in-game text and live-stream subtitles revealed that the difference in Skopos and readership fundamentally accounts for divergent translation solutions. In-game translation must prioritise functional clarity, immersion, and consistency. Subtitles, by contrast, must accommodate constraints of time and space, synchronise with voice acting, and remain accessible to a broader audience who may lack prior cultural knowledge. As such, subtitles often involve reduction for readability, explicitation to clarify implicit meaning and logical connectives, variation to avoid monotony, and annotations to bridge cultural gaps. The application of Skopos Theory has provided a unifying framework to explain these strategies. The analysis has shown that the functional purpose of each medium determines the appropriate translation choices: coherence and usability for players, clarity and narrative flow for viewers. 
Finally, this study argues that game localisation and live-stream subtitling need be approached with different translation strategies tailored for respective readerships, even when they derive from the same source text. Instead, translators must remain responsive to the communicative purpose, technical constraints, and audience expectations of different medium. 
### 5.2 Insights
One key insight that emerged from this project relates to the technical challenges of working with the dedicated translation editor provided by the AGS game engine. During the translation process, it became clear that the software is far from user-friendly. The editor can only organise text according to the numerical codes assigned to each string in the programme, rather than presenting dialogue in its narrative sequence. As a result, all lines appear in a fragmented and disordered fashion, making it extremely difficult for the translator to reconstruct the precise context in which each utterance occurs. This lack of contextual information creates a significant risk of misunderstanding the intended meaning or tone of dialogue, which in turn may compromise the accuracy and coherence of the translation. More importantly, such issues could have direct consequences for quality assurance and for the eventual release of the localised game. This highlights the need for more translator-oriented tools in game localisation, where contextual awareness is essential to producing accurate, natural, and immersive translations.
The second insight concerns the role of the translator in the practice of game localisation. Rather than remaining a passive recipient of tasks, the translator should exercise agency and actively contribute to the success of the project. This means not only carrying out the whole process of translation and localisation, but also engaging with the broader communicative and promotional goals of the product itself. For instance, in this project, the translator proposed to the developers the idea of producing a live-stream video as a promotional strategy. Furthermore, during the subtitling process, the translator modified the translation to the knowledge and cultural background of Chinese audiences by adding concise annotations and supplementary information where necessary. These interventions proved highly effective in enhancing the promotional impact of the live-stream and demonstrated the value of a translator’s initiative in shaping the reception of a localised game.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Project background
The flourishing international market has seen the rapid development of online games. As a new and powerful literary form, game culture has garnered increasing academic and public attention. Consequently, high-quality localisation and translation have become increasingly significant in order to meet the demands of a diverse global audience. In this context, the practice of localising interactive media has garnered significant attention due to its unique complexity. Game localisation is not confined to linguistic conversion. It must also handle the intertwining of multiple modes, including visual design, audio, and user interaction. Broadly speaking, game localisation refers to the process of adapting a game for players in a target country, including content and functional adjustments made to comply with local laws and market environments (Swalwell, 2021:1-15). More narrowly, it primarily focuses on the translation of in-game text, characters, plot, and scenes. The fundamental goal is to overcome a product’s inherent linguistic and cultural barriers, making the game more suitable for local players’ habits, language environment, and cognitive levels, thereby expanding the player base and increasing revenue. Consequently, game localisation is a complex, interdisciplinary process that not only involves language translation but also requires consideration of multiple dimensions, such as cultural norms, legal regulations, and technical backgrounds.
In recent years, game streaming has emerged as a rapidly growing segment of the interactive entertainment industry, attracting an expansive and diverse audience. The overall live streaming market in China has seen rapid expansion, driven by the increasing popularity of platforms like Douyin (TikTok) and Bilibili, which have surpassed more traditional, dedicated game-streaming sites in popularity. In 2024, the number of game live-stream viewers in China reached 266 million (Vyas, 2025:1). Therefore, many game developers and publishers collaborate with popular streamers, recording their gameplay sessions, editing the content into highlight reels, and distributing these videos across online streaming platforms in order to showcase the game’s appeal and broaden its player base, which has become a key marketing strategy for game developers. Consequently, the demand for live-stream subtitles has increased significantly.
However, the shift in audience to prospective consumers instead of players, along with the change in medium to promotional content instead of immersive gameplay, alters the fundamental purpose when translating live-stream subtitles compared to in-game text localisation. What’s more, the unique technical constraints inherent to the subtitle format itself further necessitate distinct translation strategies since subtitling is governed by strict spatiotemporal limitations: the text must synchronize precisely with audio and visual cues, remain on screen for a limited duration, and conform to character limits per line, which often leads to different translation strategies.

### 1.2 Significance of the project
This study is particularly significant as it addresses a notable gap in Chinese academic research on the localisation of real-time streaming games. While the field of game localisation has gained attention, this specific area of comparative study between localisation and subtitles remains largely unexplored. Therefore, the present project aims to: (1) compare both shared and different translation strategies for in-game text and live-stream subtitles; (2) explain divergences in readership and strategy through Skopos theory and multimodal translation theory; and (3) offer a theoretical framework and practical recommendations for translators and localisers working in multimodal contexts.

### 1.3 Structure of the report
This dissertation is structured into five chapters, mainly comparing translation strategies for in-game text and live-stream subtitles.
Chapter 1 introduces the research background, aims, and methodology. Chapter 2 reviews relevant translation theories, specifically Skopos Theory, and provides an analysis of the source text types. Chapter 3 delves into the Skopos Theory framework, analysing the distinct target audiences and communicative purposes for in-game text and live-stream subtitles. Chapter 4 presents a comparative analysis through specific case studies, highlighting shared and differing translation strategies such as explicitation, simplification, and dynamic variations. Chapter 5 summarises the key findings, emphasising the guiding role of Skopos Theory in game localisation and offering insights into the industry, such as the need for context-aware translation tools and the proactive role of the translator in the process. 

## Chapter 2: Preparation of Translation
The translator’s preparation for translation commonly decides the quality of translation. An optimal translation program contains “background preparation” and “actual processes”, and there are four fundamental stages in the process of translation: analysing the source text, translating source text into target text, reorganizing the target language and testing the translated text (Nida, 2001:21).
Regarding background preparation, the author engaged in a series of preparatory steps to ensure both linguistic accuracy and functional adequacy. These included background research into the historical and cultural context of the game, a comprehensive reading of the full English script to gain familiarity with its narrative flow and stylistic features, and the adoption of the developer-provided CAT tool to manage the technical aspects of localisation. Together, these measures established a solid foundation for the translation process, combining cultural knowledge, textual analysis, and technical competence.

### 2.1 About the game
_The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ is an adventure game developed by the British game studio, Afoot Games, and was released on the Steam platform on 26 March 2025. This game is adapted from Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective novel series, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Set in a cosy Sussex village called Fulworth during the early 20th century, the game depicts Sherlock Holmes in his retirement as a beekeeper, attempting to organise a clifftop picnic for Dr. John H Watson. In the process of preparing for the event, he encounters a series of unexpected local mysteries, which he must resolve using his intellect and with the assistance of his friends in the village. The whole story is made up of three main mysteries, which involves the case of a missing cat, the disappearance of a village fete judge, and a con artist who claims to have found a mermaid fossil on the beach. As players explore the game, they can talk to specific characters or investigate details in the scenes to unlock new dialogues and backstories. 
_The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ features its emphasis on exploration, dialogue, and player choice. The game has twelve fully voice-acted characters, which includes both familiar faces from the original stories and brand-new original characters. Players can interact with iconic figures like Sherlock Holmes’s loyal partner, John Watson, as well as a new cast of characters such as a clown with a tragic past, a budding young naturalist, a devoted fan of Holmes, a cunning fraudster and so on. Through a point-and-click interface, players can gather clues through examination, interact with various objects and characters, and solve puzzles that frequently offer multiple solutions by combining the findings. Also, players can move through the plot at their own pace, and as they solve these mysteries, they can also collect the items needed for the picnic in order to complete the final task and unlock the ending. In conclusion, the game’s reliance on extensive conversation and its deeply embedded cultural context makes it an ideal subject for a comparative analysis of translation strategies. 

### 2.2 Localisation software
In terms of actual translation practice, the translator relied on the developer-provided computer-assisted translation tool AGS Translation Editor (see Figure 1). This specialised software is designed to parse files generated by the Adventure Game Studio (AGS) engine, automatically extracting the in-game text into .tra files. These texts are then displayed in sequence in the main interface according to the original coding order. By referencing the source text in the left-hand column and inputting the target text in the right-hand column, the translator can export the translated content as a .trs file. This file type can be directly re-imported into the game, thereby integrating the translation smoothly into the software environment and significantly facilitating the localisation process.

### 2.3 Analysis of the Source Text
Given the multimodal and interactive nature of video games, the textual material they contain is highly heterogeneous. A clear categorisation of text types is therefore necessary to reveal how different functional roles and semiotic constraints shape translation strategies. 

#### 2.3.1 UI-related segments
Segments related to user interface (UI) constitute one of the most technical and function-oriented categories of in-game text. In _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_, dynamic prompts are the most representative example of this category. Within the game, players can perform four actions: “Pick Up”, “Examine”, “Use”, and “Converse”. Before the player confirms an action, a line of white text appears at the bottom of the screen, showing the action and the object of interaction (see Figure 2). In the code for this dynamic prompt, the object of interaction is set as a variable, which will change according to the player’s selection. Therefore, UI-related segments carry specific technical constraints because the variables are directly integrated into the game’s code. Translators must first ensure that the variable references and formatting remain intact so that the game engine can correctly display the dynamic prompts.

<img width='390' height='223' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dc42e9d-de4f-4e01-a586-ef654e19d529' />

_Figure 2: An example of dynamic prompt (Bottom)_

#### 2.3.2 Dialogues in the non-interactive cutscene
Cutscenes are non-interactive animations in which the player becomes only a viewer rather than an active participant. In _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_, cutscenes are heavily dialogue-driven and function as key narrative vehicles. They closely resemble audiovisual translation contexts such as film or television drama, in that speech, tone, and timing must be synchronised with visual and auditory cues. The translation of cutscene dialogue must therefore balance narrative fidelity with subtitling constraints, including spatial limits and temporal synchronisation. In this sense, the localisation of cutscenes in games is similar to audiovisual translation.

#### 2.3.3 Interaction with NPCs
Conversational exchanges with non-playable characters (NPCs) are central to the game’s progression. Unlike cutscenes, these dialogues are triggered by player actions. They are interactive in nature, providing players with immediate feedback. Translating NPC dialogues requires particular attention to consistency in characterisation, register, and tone, since these conversations not only deliver plot information but also contribute to world-building and player immersion. The interactive quality of NPC dialogues also implies that their localisation must anticipate multiple potential pathways, maintaining coherence across divergent branches.

#### 2.3.4 Interaction with objects
Another significant category consists of object-related interactions, whereby players inspect, manipulate, or combine items within the game space. These texts are typically short, descriptive, and functional, but they often carry narrative weight by revealing clues, unlocking further interactions, or contributing to puzzle-solving mechanics. From a translational perspective, the challenge lies in maintaining both clarity and conciseness. The target text must provide sufficient guidance without overtly undermining the immersive experience of the game itself. Furthermore, object interactions frequently involve multimodal interplay between text, visual design, and player agency, requiring translations that align seamlessly with the game’s mechanics and semiotic resources.

#### 2.3.5 Dialogues with specific cultural or historical background
The game also includes dialogues imbued with distinct cultural and historical references, particularly those related to late Victorian and Edwardian England. Such dialogues draw upon intertextual allusions, social registers, and historically embedded practices that may be unfamiliar to target audiences. For example, references to Sherlockian lore, British institutions, or early 20th century material culture pose challenges of cultural transference. This category highlights the tension between cultural authenticity and accessibility, positioning translation as a negotiation between historical fidelity and target readership comprehension.

#### 2.3.6 Special texts which are not included in the in-game text
Finally, the game includes a special category of text not embedded within the gameplay narrative or UI, such as the interlude lyrics. While not functional in a direct sense, their inclusion is a deliberate choice, intended to serve a specific expressive purpose. These songs are intentionally chosen because their lyrics are tightly interwoven with the plot, subtly reinforcing the narrative’s themes, foreshadowing upcoming events, or providing insight into a character’s emotional state. Their primary function is to deepen the player’s emotional engagement and enrich their understanding of the story beyond the main dialogue. In the process of translating song lyrics, particular attention must also be paid to preserving the original rhythm and aesthetic qualities as far as possible. 

### 2.4 Characteristics of In-Game Text and Live-Stream Subtitles
In-game text mainly appears in dialogue boxes (see Figure 3). These allow relative flexibility in restructuring language: translators can freely adjust word order, split or merge sentences, and occasionally add interpretive details as long as spatial constraints are respected. The pace of interaction is player-controlled, enabling more flexibility in stylistic and linguistic adaptation.
Live-stream subtitles are time-bound and must synchronize with the spoken audio and visual rhythm of the stream. The subtitle format imposes strict temporal and spatial constraints, requiring brevity, legibility, and alignment with oral delivery (see Figure 3). However, subtitles also offer access to the spoken context and intonation, enabling the translator to clarify or expand upon cultural elements through informative paraphrasing without disrupting user experience.

### 2.5 Project workflow
The workflow for this project was divided into two main tasks. The first stage involved the translation of the in-game text using the AGS Translation Editor. A total of 52,584 words were processed, including dialogues, UI-related segments, and texts within the game scenes or images. 
The second stage focused on the production of Chinese subtitles for a three-hour live stream video provided by the developer which showcases a portion of the plot and gameplay. Since the video content was identical to the in-game material, the subtitles were largely based on the previous translations of in-game texts which was produced in the first stage. However, in order to meet the requirements of subtitling conventions and the specific guidelines set for Chinese subtitles, necessary modifications were made to the final target texts. These included adjustments for timing, line breaks, and readability, as well as occasional annotations to aid comprehension for specific audience.


## Chapter 3: Theoretical Framework
### 3.1 Key concepts of the Skopos theory
Skopos theory developed in Germany in the 1970s and was first put forward by scholar Vermeer. “Skopos” comes from Greek, meaning “purpose”, and the term usually refers to the “communication purpose” of the target language text. As stated by Vermeer, the purpose of translation determines every action of` translation, which indicates that the purpose determines the method. 
Vermeer exercises the concept of “purpose” into translation process, pointing out that translation is a purposeful intercultural communication (activity), highlighting the decisive role of “purpose” for the entire translation practice, and advocating that the translation method is determined by the purpose of translation.
Skopos theory highlights that the translator should centre on the aimed purpose of the translation and choose translation methods in accordance with this purpose. However, the purpose of the translation determines the method or strategy. During translation, the translator must follow three main principles: Skopos rule, coherence rule and fidelity rule.
Skopos rule features core rule of Skopos theory, including the purpose of the translator, the communicative purpose of the translation, and the purpose to be completed by using certain methods. The fact that “'method is determined by result' means that the purpose determines the entire translation practice. Guided by the Skopos rule, the translator chooses corresponding translation strategies and methods to adaptably cope with the difference between the source text and the target text, which helps the target language players have a better comprehension (Chen, 2016: 89-90). In a general sense, “purpose” indicates the communicative function of the translation on the target readers in the socio-cultural context of the target language (Venuti, 2001:13). Consequently, translators initially need to comprehend the translation context and the purpose of the text before translating, and then adopt equivalent translation method based on the translation purpose.
Coherence rule means that the translation must be intra-textual coherence, and the translation must be comprehensible and appropriate. The target language readers can understand the translation, and the translation has actual meaning in both social and cultural context of the target language. The translation will not be misunderstood by target readers due to the lack of information and obstacles. A communicative interaction can only be regarded as a success if the receivers interpret it as being sufficiently coherent with their situation (Nord, 2001:32).
Fidelity rule puts forward that there must be inter-textual coherence between the source text and the target text (Munday, 2010:128). The target text must be faithful to the source text. The purpose of the translation and the translator's understanding of the source text reveal the translation’s faithfulness to the target text (R. Xu & H. Xu, 2018: 103-105). 
Among the three rules of Skopos theory, Skopos rule is the uppermost one. Fidelity rule is subsidiary to the coherence rule. At the same time, both coherence rule and fidelity rule are premised on the Skopos rule.

### 3.2 Practice under the guidance of Skopos theory
In the case of in-game text, the Skopos is to sustain immersion and ensure functional adequacy for the player. The player, conceptualised as a player-as-reader, is an active participant who advances the narrative and directly triggers the appearance of text segments through their actions. For this audience, the translation must remain unobtrusive and natural, reinforcing the illusion of direct engagement with the fictional world. Over-explanation or redundant information would undermine coherence and disrupt the immersive effect. The coherence rule here demands that the translated text integrates seamlessly into the gameplay context, while fidelity to the source is only relevant insofar as it supports this overriding purpose.
By contrast, live-stream subtitles serve a markedly different communicative purpose. Their audience extends beyond active players to include spectators and potential consumers, many of whom may have little or no prior knowledge of the game’s mechanics. The Skopos in this context is accessibility and immediate comprehensibility. Subtitles must therefore be intelligible without reliance on player interaction or contextual cues, and may legitimately employ explicitation or minor adaptation to achieve communicative efficiency. Here, the coherence rule requires that the translation aligns with the expectations and viewing conditions of a heterogeneous audience, while the fidelity rule is subordinated to the goal of maximising comprehension and sustaining attention.

### 3.3 Analysis of the target readers
From the perspective of Skopos Theory, the decisive factor shaping translational action is the orientation towards the target reader (Vermeer, 2000:18). Although the in-game text and live-stream subtitles of _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ derive from the same source material, they are designed for markedly different readerships, which results in distinct functional objectives and, consequently, divergent translational strategies.
The in-game text is primarily directed towards an audience of Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts and established fans of detective fiction, since they need to buy the game before enjoying the content. This readership is assumed to possess a certain degree of cultural literacy regarding late Victorian and Edwardian settings, as well as intertextual references to the Sherlockian canon. For such an audience, translations must ensure their sense of immersion without drawing attention by excessive interference. In this context, the coherence rule requires smooth, unobtrusive texts that integrate seamlessly with gameplay, while fidelity to the source is valued insofar as it reinforces narrative consistency and character authenticity. Excessive explanation or intrusive annotation would disrupt the immersive experience and risk alienating the fan community.
By contrast, the live-stream subtitles target a more heterogeneous and often non-specialist audience. Many viewers are casual spectators with little prior knowledge of Holmesian lore or the cultural specificities of nineteenth-century Britain. The Skopos here shifts from immersion to accessibility and promotion. Subtitles are expected not only to render the narrative intelligible but also to stimulate interest in the game as a cultural product. To achieve this, the translator may resort to explicitation, additional annotation, or the amplification of metaphorical expressions that might otherwise remain opaque to non-fans. In this way, subtitles function as a mediating tool that lowers the barrier to entry and, in line with their promotional function, encourages wider audience engagement.
In sum, although both modalities share the general purpose of making the narrative accessible, their differing target readers necessitate divergent strategies. The in-game text privileges immersion for a knowledgeable fanbase, whereas live-stream subtitles prioritise clarity and appeal for broader audiences. Skopos theory provides a principled framework for explaining this divergence by situating translation decisions within the communicative needs of their respective readerships.

## Chapter 4: Case Study (English-Chinese part)
Building on the typological and theoretical groundwork established in the previous chapter, this section turns to a detailed case study of selected source texts from _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_. The analysis focuses on how the same textual material is localised under both in-game text and live-stream subtitles, and how their respective Skopos and text types guide the practice of translation. 
The discussion is organised into two parts. The first examines shared strategies, i.e. those approaches that operate across both modalities regardless of medium, reflecting common functional requirements such as maintaining narrative coherence or ensuring linguistic naturalness. The second investigates differentiated strategies, where divergences arise due to variations in communicative purpose and target readership. 

### 4.1 Shared strategies of translating in-game texts and live-stream subtitles
#### 4.1.1 Explicitation of logical connectives
The Chinese language is characterised as a language of parataxis. Chinese tends to use a series of relatively short, independent clauses placed in sequence to form a sentence or a text. This feature renders the connections within Chinese texts more organic and flexible, which means that Chinese readers rely more heavily on context to understand the logical relationships between sentences (Li, 2025:9). Consequently, adding logical connectives that are implicit in the source text can enhance the coherence of the target text during translation. This approach not only aligns more closely with Chinese expressive and reading conventions but also ensures greater fluency and naturalness in the translated text. Through the translation strategy of explicitation of connectives, the cognitive load for both game players and live-stream viewers can be reduced. 
The following paragraphs provide a detailed analysis of an example in my practice. 

<img width='1353' height='486' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02b1ea16-be89-407c-87c9-bb0e0df8e7f0' />

In example 1 (see Table 1), an NPC named Ruffles were talking about his tragic experiences with Holmes in the World War I. In the source text, the first sentence states the fact that Ruffles’s eye was injured, while the second sentence describes the treatment he received at the hospital and the positive outcome. The shift in emotion is only implicitly conveyed by the context in the source text. Therefore, by adding “幸运的是” (fortunately) in the target text, this turning point and emotional shift are made explicit to the audience. This allows both the players and viewers to immediately feel the change from misfortune to good luck without having to infer the logical connection, which not only aligns with the language habits of the target audience but also improves the text’s fluency and narrative pace, in line with the functional approach emphasised by Skopos Theory. 
More importantly, the addition of this logical connective also resonates with the visual elements in the game and the live-stream. As shown in Figure 4, when delivering the first line, Ruffles closes his eyes with a deeply sorrowful expression, reflecting his inner pain. However, his expression turns to one of relief in the second sentence. By explicating the logical relation between the two sentences, the translation allows the dialogue to interact harmoniously with the visual cues on the screen, thereby enhancing the sense of immersion for both players and viewers.

_Figure 4: Screenshot of example 1_

In addition, the translation of the first sentence is also adapted in light of the visual cues. From Ruffles’s portrait in Figure 4, it is evident that he wears an eyepatch over his left eye, confirming that “one eye gone” in the original refers specifically to his left eye. A literal rendering such as “一只眼睛失明，另一只眼睛角膜受损” (one eye is blind, and the other eye’s cornea is damaged) would sound redundant in Chinese. Instead, drawing on the visual information to translate them directly as “左眼彻底失明” (my left eye is completely blind) and “右眼角膜受损” (my right eye’s cornea is damaged) enables the audience to process the plot more quickly and smoothly. 

#### 4.1.2 Explicitation of semantic information
Similarly, explicating semantic information explicit in the original text can also clarify meanings that would otherwise rely on context or inference, thereby serving the shared purpose of enhancing immersion. 

<img width='1368' height='647' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfd5b840-295c-4103-8d93-e3e0e5b2aa48' />

Example 2 (see Table 2) presents a dialogue in which Holmes notices Watson reading a mystery novel. As Watson is also writing biographies of Holmes’s cases which can also be classified as mystery novel, Holmes assumes that Watson’s purpose in reading this book is to “familiarise with his competition.” However, a literal translation of this phrase into Chinese such as “熟悉你的比赛” would not only sound unnatural but would also create obstacles to readers’ comprehension. Therefore, in the translation of Holmes’s question, his semantic information is made explicit by adding the clue of “作家同行” (fellow writer) in order to convey the underlying intent of Holmes’s question more clearly.
Then in Watson’s reply, the translation renders “little story” as “推理小说” (mystery novel) further explicating the central topic of the dialogue and clarifying the implication of Holmes’s question, thereby facilitating the reader’s comprehension of the plot development. Moreover, since the previous sentence is a question, the Chinese translation chooses to add a direct response “没有” (no), which strengthens the coherence between the dialogues and ensures greater logical fluency.
In conclusion, this translation ensures that the dialogue remains coherent and readily accessible to the target audience. Adapting the wording to make implicit relations explicit and to enhance logical flow serves the communicative function of the translation, prioritising audience understanding and narrative continuity over literal fidelity to the source text.

#### 4.1.3 Contextual adaptation

<img width='1322' height='804' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5633ea2-8560-4172-9767-652c9c7cb930' />

Example 3 (see Table 3) presents a quarrel between Holmes and a fraudster. In the previous plot, Holmes, by examining Pippi’s so-called “mermaid”, discovered evidence of forgery and deduced that it had been fabricated by stitching together the specimens of a monkey and a fish. Holmes hoped to restore peace to the beach occupied by crowds drawn by Pippi and her mermaid, but her refusal to listen or to leave gradually provoked his anger during their conversation. The emotional shift between the two characters is conveyed through the game’s voice acting, so the dialogue itself should correspond to this change of feeling to enhance immersion. In the source text, their dialogues are almost identical, relying only on slight changes in sentence length and punctuation to suggest a progression of tone. A literal reproduction of this repetition in Chinese would appear rigid and unnatural, lacking the sense of authentic dialogue.
Therefore, in my translation, each line is adapted according to the narrative context. For example, Pippi’s the response “没有就是没有” (I told you didn’t) reinforces her persistence and growing impatience; and her third, “才没有呢!” (I certainly didn’t!) is more colloquial and emotionally charged, showing her outburst. This gradual variation aligns with Chinese colloquial expressions. At the same time, for Holmes’s line is also adapted entirely. The original “Indeed you did” is translated as “证据确凿” (The evidence is conclusive), which can resonate with the preceding scene in which Holmes investigates Pippi’s “mermaid and uncovers evidence of forgery, reinforcing his identity as a detective. And “You did!” was translated as “你撒谎!” to avoid repetition and enhance dramatic tension. 
From the perspective of Skopos Theory, this approach fulfils the communicative purpose of the translation by enhancing linguistic naturalness, highlighting characterisation, and supporting narrative development. 

### 4.2 Different strategies of translating in-game texts and live-stream subtitles
#### 4.2.1 Simplification in subtitles
When comparing in-game text with live-stream subtitles, one of the most obvious differences lies in the restrictions imposed on subtitles by time and space. Subtitles must appear on screen in synchrony with spoken audio, remain visible long enough to be read comfortably, and occupy limited screen space without obscuring key visual elements. Therefore, subtitles must prioritise brevity, legibility, and rhythmical alignment with oral delivery. This means that subtitles need to selectively omit content unrelated to the plot itself to maintain the greatest possible conciseness, which ensures smooth processing and uninterrupted immersion for video viewers.

<img width='1302' height='927' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b491a34d-f6f1-4a52-9af2-ffb324b687e3' />

Example 4 is a prompt triggered when the player interacts with the telephone during the investigation stage. In _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_, in order to prevent players from feeling uncertain about how to advance the storyline and to enhance the smoothness of gameplay, the developer introduced a special function that allows Holmes to contact his brother Mycroft through the telephone in the scene and seek his advice. Mycroft’s suggestions change dynamically according to the player’s progress in the game.
Within the game itself, such prompt plays a crucial functional role because it can indicate possible actions for players to avoid causing confusion. According to Skopos Theory, the communicative purpose of in-game translation is therefore not only to preserve narrative fidelity but also to maintain the usability and playability of the product. For this reason, prompts and operational instructions must be retained to fulfil their purpose.
By contrast, in the context of live-stream subtitles, the audience assumes a very different role. Viewers are not participants in gameplay, and thus do not require operational guidance. The Skopos of the subtitle text is to provide an accessible narrative experience, highlighting plot development rather than procedural accuracy. Accordingly, the translator can omit such prompts if necessary. This reduction serves two functions. First, it can avoid distracting the audience with information irrelevant to their experience. Second, it will lower the reading burden by reducing the volume of subtitle text, thereby preserving immersion in the unfolding story.
In the in-game text of example 4, in order to emphasize the location and function of this telephone, the source text in game specifically highlights “use the telephone” and “when I’m at loss.” In the localisation practice, both elements are retained in order to fulfil their functional purpose. However, in the case of subtitles, such information is unnecessary for the viewers. So these parts are intentionally omitted so as to preserve the brevity of the subtitles.

#### 4.2.2 Dynamic variation
In some cases, the dialogues triggered by different in-game interactions are the same. As a result, the in-game translation can only provide a general translation since in programming, one dialogue code can only correspond to one string of text. By contrast, subtitles for live-streams are not bound by this technical limitation. The translator can therefore adapt the same source text in different ways according to the surrounding context and narrative situation, producing variation that feels more natural and expressive. 

<img width='1317' height='1205' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecfbd780-f00d-45af-bd99-562fbf05345e' />

Example 5 (see Table 5) appears in the investigation stage at Baker Street. When the player attempts to “converse” with irrelevant items, such as slippers, paintings, or the carpet, Watson would ask whether he is “slightly bored.” Therefore, the same dialogue can be repeatedly triggered in a short span of time within the same scene, and the same dialogue was likewise repeated within less than five minutes in the live-stream. Although the in-game text cannot be altered, the subtitles allow for greater flexibility. To avoid repetition, when the line appeared a second time, I chose to rendered Watson’s question into “are you sure you’re all right”, which both prevented redundancy and subtly suggested a progression in Watson’s emotional state, conveying greater concern the second time he posed the question to Holmes.

<img width='1320' height='513' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cc0a7b6-9a28-4f4c-8b76-589e27a22833' />

Similarly, in Example 6 (see Table 6), the live-stream subtitles were adapted in order to create variation between the two identical dialogues and to allow them to integrate more smoothly into the narrative. In the live-stream, the first time Holmes calls the dog Toby it is to take him to the crime scene, while the second time it is to send him home. Accordingly, I adapted the translation in line with the corresponding context.
In conclusion, the Skopos of subtitles is enhancing narrative flow and immersion for viewers, so dynamic variation has the ability to reflect the psychological activities of a character under different contextual situation. Through reducing redundancy, aligning the language more closely with natural conversational patterns, the subtitles can ultimately offer the audience a smoother and more engaging viewing experience.

#### 4.2.3 Adding annotations in subtitles
_The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ is a game adapted from the Sherlock Holmes series, and therefore some dialogues involve direct references or creative adaptations of the canon. As discussed in Chapter 3, the target readers of the game are mainly those who already possess familiarity with the relevant cultural background. however, the live-stream is intended as a form of promotion, meaning that a significant proportion of its target readers may lack relevant knowledge. Without appropriate explanation, viewers of the live-stream videos may feel confused by the plot and be unable to appreciate the humour in the source text, thereby undermining the purpose of attracting a wider audience. 
Since only subtitles can have annotations added, the example below shows only the translation of live-stream subtitles and the corresponding annotation.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0154917d-8ea9-4e10-8ddc-36673d3e5c74)

In Example 7 (See Table 7), Holmes is talking to an NPC named “Ruffles.” Because the pronunciation of “Raffles” and “Ruffles” is similar, Holmes mistakenly assumes that this NPC is a relative of Raffles the cricketer. To understand the humour underlying this exchange, it is necessary to be aware of a specific cultural background that Raffles was a criminal character created by Conan Doyle’s brother-in-law, who took inspiration from Holmes himself. Since Holmes is a detective who pursues criminals, he ironically remarks that they are “in the same circle.” To assist the audience of live-stream in grasping this allusion, a brief but essential annotation is added to the top right of the screen (see Figure 5), which not only supports comprehension of the scene but also enables interested viewers to seek out further information and expand their knowledge.

<img width='398' height='223' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0af91934-bf8c-42b5-a644-4812d9567421' />

_Figure 5: Screenshot of example 7_

Annotations can contribute to the Skopos of the live-stream by attracting and engaging a wider audience by making the content accessible. However, the coherence rule of Skopos Theory also requires that the translation be easily processable for the target audience. If annotations are overly long or with relevant information, they risk imposing a cognitive burden on viewers, distracting them from the dialogues and plots. For this reason, annotations must remain concise, offering only the essential cultural or contextual information. 

#### 4.2.4 Synchronisation of subtitles
Subtitles are required to remain closely synchronised with the accompanying audio, as they must appear and disappear in tandem with the spoken dialogue. This temporal constraint means that long or complex sentences in the source text cannot always be transferred directly into the target text without risking a mismatch between reading time and speech rhythm. To address this, translators often reformulate or restructure longer sentences in line with the pauses and intonation patterns of the voice acting. Such adaptation not only maintains synchrony but also ensures that the subtitles can be read comfortably within the limited time available, thereby preserving both comprehensibility and immersion for the audience.

<img width='1299' height='999' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adf44f5f-0519-4bbb-9c30-ff5266968919' />

In example 8 (see Table 8), Holmes makes an impossible request of his housekeeper Martha, which makes her quite agitated. To convey her impatience and anger, the in-game voice acting is delivered at a very rapid pace with only one pauses after “drop everything”. So, the subtitles not only should the wording be reduced in length to accommodate the speed of delivery, but the frequency of punctuation-based segmentation also needs to be minimised. By doing so, the rhythm of the subtitles can better align with the rapid speech, thereby reinforcing the emotional intensity of the scene. 
In this example, the source text contains multiple clauses joined in sequence, reflecting Martha’s frustration at Holmes’s unreasonable demand. If translated literally into Chinese, the subtitles would be too lengthy for comfortable reading within the limited time available on screen, and the frequent pauses marked by commas in English would make synchronisation with the rapid delivery of the voice acting difficult. Therefore, the multiple procedural steps of “drop everything, go to the shops, acquire additional food” are adapted into a metaphorical expression “就算我是魔法师” (even if I were a magician), which conveys impossibility in a more vivid and simple way. This strategy not only shortens the subtitle to suit the fast-paced delivery but also successfully recreates the pauses in the source text, thereby better matching the rhythm of the audio performance. At the same time, the figurative phrasing intensifies Martha’s emotional state by highlighting her exasperation in a culturally natural and emphatic manner.

#### 4.2.5 Audience-oriented adaptations
The same source text may yield different translations in the contexts of in-game dialogue and live-stream subtitles because of the distinct functions and communicative environments of the two media. In-game text is closely tied to interactivity: it must respond to player actions, provide operational clarity, and maintain immersion within the flow of gameplay. Subtitles, by contrast, are designed for a viewing audience who are not active participants but observers. Therefore, when translating subtitles, it is often necessary to explain and supplement the conditions and objects that trigger the dialogue. As a result, the Skopos of each medium diverges, and this divergence naturally leads to variation in translation strategies. What appears redundant or distracting in a subtitle may be essential in the game, and what is immersive in gameplay may be confusing for viewers without contextual cues. So, recognising these differing communicative purposes of their audience is crucial to understanding why identical source text is rendered differently across the two media.

<img width='1305' height='590' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd13a4d5-3265-4c96-bd64-c191b3d52748' />

In example 9 (see Table 9), the same source text is translated differently in the game and in the live-stream subtitles. After Watson’s leg injury, if Holmes interacts with his leg by pressing the “Examine” button, this dialogue will be triggered.
In the in-game localisation, Waston’s first sentence is simplified as “别动” (Stop). This is because the players are directly engaged in the interaction that triggers this response, and they are already aware of what action has been performed. Thus, the translation does not need to repeat or clarify the content of interaction. A shorter and more direct form such as “别动” can reinforce immediacy, and strengthens immersion by aligning with the player’s embodied experience.
In contrast, the live-stream audience does not share the player’s interactive perspective and may not immediately understand why Watson suddenly protests if they didn’t notice the previous action in the video. To avoid potential confusion, the subtitles choose to make the object explicit by specifying both the object and the content of this action, and translated it as “别折腾我的腿了” (stop messing with my leg). By pointing out “the leg,” the subtitles provide viewers with sufficient information to grasp the cause of Watson’s reaction, thereby ensuring narrative clarity.
Audience-oriented adaptations highlight the principle that the same line of source text may require divergent treatments depending on the audience’s role and perspective. In-game text prioritises immersion and logical coherence within interactive gameplay, while live-stream subtitles prioritise accessibility and comprehension for non-participatory viewers. Their divergent Skopos therefore demonstrate the translator’s ability to align with the communicative purpose of each medium.


## Chapter 5: Conclusion and Insights
Through the translation practice of _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_, the translator has learned and accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience about the process of game localisation and subtitling. What’s more, the translator have also identified some issues that both industry professionals and game developers often overlook, which may impact localisation quality.
### 5.1 Conclusion
This report has explored the distinctive challenges and strategies involved in translating _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ across two different media: in-game text and live-stream subtitles. 
Through practice and analysis, it can be found that Skopos Theory plays a guiding role in video game localisation. The game itself is a purposeful communicative behaviour. Different types of games have different purposes, and different types of text in a game also have different functions and purposes (Fang, 2016:103-108). Therefore, when translating video games, it is necessary to help players from different cultural backgrounds have the same game experience by following three rules of Skopos Theory. Only by meeting players’ demands and expectations for the game text can a game be recognised by target players and succeed in the international market.
The comparison between in-game text and live-stream subtitles revealed that the difference in Skopos and readership fundamentally accounts for divergent translation solutions. In-game translation must prioritise functional clarity, immersion, and consistency. Subtitles, by contrast, must accommodate constraints of time and space, synchronise with voice acting, and remain accessible to a broader audience who may lack prior cultural knowledge. As such, subtitles often involve reduction for readability, explicitation to clarify implicit meaning and logical connectives, variation to avoid monotony, and annotations to bridge cultural gaps. The application of Skopos Theory has provided a unifying framework to explain these strategies. The analysis has shown that the functional purpose of each medium determines the appropriate translation choices: coherence and usability for players, clarity and narrative flow for viewers. 
Finally, this study argues that game localisation and live-stream subtitling need be approached with different translation strategies tailored for respective readerships, even when they derive from the same source text. Instead, translators must remain responsive to the communicative purpose, technical constraints, and audience expectations of different medium. 
### 5.2 Insights
One key insight that emerged from this project relates to the technical challenges of working with the dedicated translation editor provided by the AGS game engine. During the translation process, it became clear that the software is far from user-friendly. The editor can only organise text according to the numerical codes assigned to each string in the programme, rather than presenting dialogue in its narrative sequence. As a result, all lines appear in a fragmented and disordered fashion, making it extremely difficult for the translator to reconstruct the precise context in which each utterance occurs. This lack of contextual information creates a significant risk of misunderstanding the intended meaning or tone of dialogue, which in turn may compromise the accuracy and coherence of the translation. More importantly, such issues could have direct consequences for quality assurance and for the eventual release of the localised game. This highlights the need for more translator-oriented tools in game localisation, where contextual awareness is essential to producing accurate, natural, and immersive translations.
The second insight concerns the role of the translator in the practice of game localisation. Rather than remaining a passive recipient of tasks, the translator should exercise agency and actively contribute to the success of the project. This means not only carrying out the whole process of translation and localisation, but also engaging with the broader communicative and promotional goals of the product itself. For instance, in this project, the translator proposed to the developers the idea of producing a live-stream video as a promotional strategy. Furthermore, during the subtitling process, the translator modified the translation to the knowledge and cultural background of Chinese audiences by adding concise annotations and supplementary information where necessary. These interventions proved highly effective in enhancing the promotional impact of the live-stream and demonstrated the value of a translator’s initiative in shaping the reception of a localised game.

<h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1 Project background</h3>
<p>The flourishing international market has seen the rapid development of online games. As a new and powerful literary form, game culture has garnered increasing academic and public attention. Consequently, high-quality localisation and translation have become increasingly significant in order to meet the demands of a diverse global audience. In this context, the practice of localising interactive media has garnered significant attention due to its unique complexity. Game localisation is not confined to linguistic conversion. It must also handle the intertwining of multiple modes, including visual design, audio, and user interaction. Broadly speaking, game localisation refers to the process of adapting a game for players in a target country, including content and functional adjustments made to comply with local laws and market environments (Swalwell, 2021:1-15). More narrowly, it primarily focuses on the translation of in-game text, characters, plot, and scenes. The fundamental goal is to overcome a product’s inherent linguistic and cultural barriers, making the game more suitable for local players’ habits, language environment, and cognitive levels, thereby expanding the player base and increasing revenue. Consequently, game localisation is a complex, interdisciplinary process that not only involves language translation but also requires consideration of multiple dimensions, such as cultural norms, legal regulations, and technical backgrounds.<br>
In recent years, game streaming has emerged as a rapidly growing segment of the interactive entertainment industry, attracting an expansive and diverse audience. The overall live streaming market in China has seen rapid expansion, driven by the increasing popularity of platforms like Douyin (TikTok) and Bilibili, which have surpassed more traditional, dedicated game-streaming sites in popularity. In 2024, the number of game live-stream viewers in China reached 266 million (Vyas, 2025:1). Therefore, many game developers and publishers collaborate with popular streamers, recording their gameplay sessions, editing the content into highlight reels, and distributing these videos across online streaming platforms in order to showcase the game’s appeal and broaden its player base, which has become a key marketing strategy for game developers. Consequently, the demand for live-stream subtitles has increased significantly.<br>
However, the shift in audience to prospective consumers instead of players, along with the change in medium to promotional content instead of immersive gameplay, alters the fundamental purpose when translating live-stream subtitles compared to in-game text localisation. What’s more, the unique technical constraints inherent to the subtitle format itself further necessitate distinct translation strategies since subtitling is governed by strict spatiotemporal limitations: the text must synchronize precisely with audio and visual cues, remain on screen for a limited duration, and conform to character limits per line, which often leads to different translation strategies.</p>
<h3>1.2 Significance of the project</h3>
<p>This study is particularly significant as it addresses a notable gap in Chinese academic research on the localisation of real-time streaming games. While the field of game localisation has gained attention, this specific area of comparative study between localisation and subtitles remains largely unexplored. Therefore, the present project aims to: (1) compare both shared and different translation strategies for in-game text and live-stream subtitles; (2) explain divergences in readership and strategy through Skopos theory and multimodal translation theory; and (3) offer a theoretical framework and practical recommendations for translators and localisers working in multimodal contexts.</p>
<h3>1.3 Structure of the report</h3>
<p>This dissertation is structured into five chapters, mainly comparing translation strategies for in-game text and live-stream subtitles.<br>
Chapter 1 introduces the research background, aims, and methodology. Chapter 2 reviews relevant translation theories, specifically Skopos Theory, and provides an analysis of the source text types. Chapter 3 delves into the Skopos Theory framework, analysing the distinct target audiences and communicative purposes for in-game text and live-stream subtitles. Chapter 4 presents a comparative analysis through specific case studies, highlighting shared and differing translation strategies such as explicitation, simplification, and dynamic variations. Chapter 5 summarises the key findings, emphasising the guiding role of Skopos Theory in game localisation and offering insights into the industry, such as the need for context-aware translation tools and the proactive role of the translator in the process.</p>
<h2>Chapter 2: Preparation of Translation</h2>
<p>The translator’s preparation for translation commonly decides the quality of translation. An optimal translation program contains “background preparation” and “actual processes”, and there are four fundamental stages in the process of translation: analysing the source text, translating source text into target text, reorganizing the target language and testing the translated text (Nida, 2001:21).<br>
Regarding background preparation, the author engaged in a series of preparatory steps to ensure both linguistic accuracy and functional adequacy. These included background research into the historical and cultural context of the game, a comprehensive reading of the full English script to gain familiarity with its narrative flow and stylistic features, and the adoption of the developer-provided CAT tool to manage the technical aspects of localisation. Together, these measures established a solid foundation for the translation process, combining cultural knowledge, textual analysis, and technical competence.</p>
<h3>2.1 About the game</h3>
<p><em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> is an adventure game developed by the British game studio, Afoot Games, and was released on the Steam platform on 26 March 2025. This game is adapted from Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective novel series, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Set in a cosy Sussex village called Fulworth during the early 20th century, the game depicts Sherlock Holmes in his retirement as a beekeeper, attempting to organise a clifftop picnic for Dr. John H Watson. In the process of preparing for the event, he encounters a series of unexpected local mysteries, which he must resolve using his intellect and with the assistance of his friends in the village. The whole story is made up of three main mysteries, which involves the case of a missing cat, the disappearance of a village fete judge, and a con artist who claims to have found a mermaid fossil on the beach. As players explore the game, they can talk to specific characters or investigate details in the scenes to unlock new dialogues and backstories.<br>
<em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> features its emphasis on exploration, dialogue, and player choice. The game has twelve fully voice-acted characters, which includes both familiar faces from the original stories and brand-new original characters. Players can interact with iconic figures like Sherlock Holmes’s loyal partner, John Watson, as well as a new cast of characters such as a clown with a tragic past, a budding young naturalist, a devoted fan of Holmes, a cunning fraudster and so on. Through a point-and-click interface, players can gather clues through examination, interact with various objects and characters, and solve puzzles that frequently offer multiple solutions by combining the findings. Also, players can move through the plot at their own pace, and as they solve these mysteries, they can also collect the items needed for the picnic in order to complete the final task and unlock the ending. In conclusion, the game’s reliance on extensive conversation and its deeply embedded cultural context makes it an ideal subject for a comparative analysis of translation strategies.</p>
<h3>2.2 Localisation software</h3>
<p>In terms of actual translation practice, the translator relied on the developer-provided computer-assisted translation tool AGS Translation Editor (see Figure 1). This specialised software is designed to parse files generated by the Adventure Game Studio (AGS) engine, automatically extracting the in-game text into .tra files. These texts are then displayed in sequence in the main interface according to the original coding order. By referencing the source text in the left-hand column and inputting the target text in the right-hand column, the translator can export the translated content as a .trs file. This file type can be directly re-imported into the game, thereby integrating the translation smoothly into the software environment and significantly facilitating the localisation process.</p>

<h3>2.3 Analysis of the Source Text</h3>
<p>Given the multimodal and interactive nature of video games, the textual material they contain is highly heterogeneous. A clear categorisation of text types is therefore necessary to reveal how different functional roles and semiotic constraints shape translation strategies.</p>
<h4>2.3.1 UI-related segments</h4>
<p>Segments related to user interface (UI) constitute one of the most technical and function-oriented categories of in-game text. In <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em>, dynamic prompts are the most representative example of this category. Within the game, players can perform four actions: “Pick Up”, “Examine”, “Use”, and “Converse”. Before the player confirms an action, a line of white text appears at the bottom of the screen, showing the action and the object of interaction (see Figure 2). In the code for this dynamic prompt, the object of interaction is set as a variable, which will change according to the player’s selection. Therefore, UI-related segments carry specific technical constraints because the variables are directly integrated into the game’s code. Translators must first ensure that the variable references and formatting remain intact so that the game engine can correctly display the dynamic prompts.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dc42e9d-de4f-4e01-a586-ef654e19d529"><img width="390" height="223" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dc42e9d-de4f-4e01-a586-ef654e19d529" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 223px;"></a></p>
<p><em>Figure 2: An example of dynamic prompt (Bottom)</em></p>
<h4>2.3.2 Dialogues in the non-interactive cutscene</h4>
<p>Cutscenes are non-interactive animations in which the player becomes only a viewer rather than an active participant. In <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em>, cutscenes are heavily dialogue-driven and function as key narrative vehicles. They closely resemble audiovisual translation contexts such as film or television drama, in that speech, tone, and timing must be synchronised with visual and auditory cues. The translation of cutscene dialogue must therefore balance narrative fidelity with subtitling constraints, including spatial limits and temporal synchronisation. In this sense, the localisation of cutscenes in games is similar to audiovisual translation.</p>
<h4>2.3.3 Interaction with NPCs</h4>
<p>Conversational exchanges with non-playable characters (NPCs) are central to the game’s progression. Unlike cutscenes, these dialogues are triggered by player actions. They are interactive in nature, providing players with immediate feedback. Translating NPC dialogues requires particular attention to consistency in characterisation, register, and tone, since these conversations not only deliver plot information but also contribute to world-building and player immersion. The interactive quality of NPC dialogues also implies that their localisation must anticipate multiple potential pathways, maintaining coherence across divergent branches.</p>
<h4>2.3.4 Interaction with objects</h4>
<p>Another significant category consists of object-related interactions, whereby players inspect, manipulate, or combine items within the game space. These texts are typically short, descriptive, and functional, but they often carry narrative weight by revealing clues, unlocking further interactions, or contributing to puzzle-solving mechanics. From a translational perspective, the challenge lies in maintaining both clarity and conciseness. The target text must provide sufficient guidance without overtly undermining the immersive experience of the game itself. Furthermore, object interactions frequently involve multimodal interplay between text, visual design, and player agency, requiring translations that align seamlessly with the game’s mechanics and semiotic resources.</p>
<h4>2.3.5 Dialogues with specific cultural or historical background</h4>
<p>The game also includes dialogues imbued with distinct cultural and historical references, particularly those related to late Victorian and Edwardian England. Such dialogues draw upon intertextual allusions, social registers, and historically embedded practices that may be unfamiliar to target audiences. For example, references to Sherlockian lore, British institutions, or early 20th century material culture pose challenges of cultural transference. This category highlights the tension between cultural authenticity and accessibility, positioning translation as a negotiation between historical fidelity and target readership comprehension.</p>
<h4>2.3.6 Special texts which are not included in the in-game text</h4>
<p>Finally, the game includes a special category of text not embedded within the gameplay narrative or UI, such as the interlude lyrics. While not functional in a direct sense, their inclusion is a deliberate choice, intended to serve a specific expressive purpose. These songs are intentionally chosen because their lyrics are tightly interwoven with the plot, subtly reinforcing the narrative’s themes, foreshadowing upcoming events, or providing insight into a character’s emotional state. Their primary function is to deepen the player’s emotional engagement and enrich their understanding of the story beyond the main dialogue. In the process of translating song lyrics, particular attention must also be paid to preserving the original rhythm and aesthetic qualities as far as possible.</p>
<h3>2.4 Characteristics of In-Game Text and Live-Stream Subtitles</h3>
<p>In-game text mainly appears in dialogue boxes (see Figure 3). These allow relative flexibility in restructuring language: translators can freely adjust word order, split or merge sentences, and occasionally add interpretive details as long as spatial constraints are respected. The pace of interaction is player-controlled, enabling more flexibility in stylistic and linguistic adaptation.<br>
Live-stream subtitles are time-bound and must synchronize with the spoken audio and visual rhythm of the stream. The subtitle format imposes strict temporal and spatial constraints, requiring brevity, legibility, and alignment with oral delivery (see Figure 3). However, subtitles also offer access to the spoken context and intonation, enabling the translator to clarify or expand upon cultural elements through informative paraphrasing without disrupting user experience.</p>

<h3>2.5 Project workflow</h3>
<p>The workflow for this project was divided into two main tasks. The first stage involved the translation of the in-game text using the AGS Translation Editor. A total of 52,584 words were processed, including dialogues, UI-related segments, and texts within the game scenes or images.<br>
The second stage focused on the production of Chinese subtitles for a three-hour live stream video provided by the developer which showcases a portion of the plot and gameplay. Since the video content was identical to the in-game material, the subtitles were largely based on the previous translations of in-game texts which was produced in the first stage. However, in order to meet the requirements of subtitling conventions and the specific guidelines set for Chinese subtitles, necessary modifications were made to the final target texts. These included adjustments for timing, line breaks, and readability, as well as occasional annotations to aid comprehension for specific audience.</p>
<h2>Chapter 3: Theoretical Framework</h2>
<h3>3.1 Key concepts of the Skopos theory</h3>
<p>Skopos theory developed in Germany in the 1970s and was first put forward by scholar Vermeer. “Skopos” comes from Greek, meaning “purpose”, and the term usually refers to the “communication purpose” of the target language text. As stated by Vermeer, the purpose of translation determines every action of` translation, which indicates that the purpose determines the method.<br>
Vermeer exercises the concept of “purpose” into translation process, pointing out that translation is a purposeful intercultural communication (activity), highlighting the decisive role of “purpose” for the entire translation practice, and advocating that the translation method is determined by the purpose of translation.<br>
Skopos theory highlights that the translator should centre on the aimed purpose of the translation and choose translation methods in accordance with this purpose. However, the purpose of the translation determines the method or strategy. During translation, the translator must follow three main principles: Skopos rule, coherence rule and fidelity rule.<br>
Skopos rule features core rule of Skopos theory, including the purpose of the translator, the communicative purpose of the translation, and the purpose to be completed by using certain methods. The fact that “'method is determined by result" means that the purpose determines the entire translation practice. Guided by the Skopos rule, the translator chooses corresponding translation strategies and methods to adaptably cope with the difference between the source text and the target text, which helps the target language players have a better comprehension (Chen, 2016: 89-90). In a general sense, “purpose” indicates the communicative function of the translation on the target readers in the socio-cultural context of the target language (Venuti, 2001:13). Consequently, translators initially need to comprehend the translation context and the purpose of the text before translating, and then adopt equivalent translation method based on the translation purpose.<br>
Coherence rule means that the translation must be intra-textual coherence, and the translation must be comprehensible and appropriate. The target language readers can understand the translation, and the translation has actual meaning in both social and cultural context of the target language. The translation will not be misunderstood by target readers due to the lack of information and obstacles. A communicative interaction can only be regarded as a success if the receivers interpret it as being sufficiently coherent with their situation (Nord, 2001:32).<br>
Fidelity rule puts forward that there must be inter-textual coherence between the source text and the target text (Munday, 2010:128). The target text must be faithful to the source text. The purpose of the translation and the translator's understanding of the source text reveal the translation’s faithfulness to the target text (R. Xu &amp; H. Xu, 2018: 103-105).<br>
Among the three rules of Skopos theory, Skopos rule is the uppermost one. Fidelity rule is subsidiary to the coherence rule. At the same time, both coherence rule and fidelity rule are premised on the Skopos rule.</p>
<h3>3.2 Practice under the guidance of Skopos theory</h3>
<p>In the case of in-game text, the Skopos is to sustain immersion and ensure functional adequacy for the player. The player, conceptualised as a player-as-reader, is an active participant who advances the narrative and directly triggers the appearance of text segments through their actions. For this audience, the translation must remain unobtrusive and natural, reinforcing the illusion of direct engagement with the fictional world. Over-explanation or redundant information would undermine coherence and disrupt the immersive effect. The coherence rule here demands that the translated text integrates seamlessly into the gameplay context, while fidelity to the source is only relevant insofar as it supports this overriding purpose.<br>
By contrast, live-stream subtitles serve a markedly different communicative purpose. Their audience extends beyond active players to include spectators and potential consumers, many of whom may have little or no prior knowledge of the game’s mechanics. The Skopos in this context is accessibility and immediate comprehensibility. Subtitles must therefore be intelligible without reliance on player interaction or contextual cues, and may legitimately employ explicitation or minor adaptation to achieve communicative efficiency. Here, the coherence rule requires that the translation aligns with the expectations and viewing conditions of a heterogeneous audience, while the fidelity rule is subordinated to the goal of maximising comprehension and sustaining attention.</p>
<h3>3.3 Analysis of the target readers</h3>
<p>From the perspective of Skopos Theory, the decisive factor shaping translational action is the orientation towards the target reader (Vermeer, 2000:18). Although the in-game text and live-stream subtitles of <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> derive from the same source material, they are designed for markedly different readerships, which results in distinct functional objectives and, consequently, divergent translational strategies.<br>
The in-game text is primarily directed towards an audience of Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts and established fans of detective fiction, since they need to buy the game before enjoying the content. This readership is assumed to possess a certain degree of cultural literacy regarding late Victorian and Edwardian settings, as well as intertextual references to the Sherlockian canon. For such an audience, translations must ensure their sense of immersion without drawing attention by excessive interference. In this context, the coherence rule requires smooth, unobtrusive texts that integrate seamlessly with gameplay, while fidelity to the source is valued insofar as it reinforces narrative consistency and character authenticity. Excessive explanation or intrusive annotation would disrupt the immersive experience and risk alienating the fan community.<br>
By contrast, the live-stream subtitles target a more heterogeneous and often non-specialist audience. Many viewers are casual spectators with little prior knowledge of Holmesian lore or the cultural specificities of nineteenth-century Britain. The Skopos here shifts from immersion to accessibility and promotion. Subtitles are expected not only to render the narrative intelligible but also to stimulate interest in the game as a cultural product. To achieve this, the translator may resort to explicitation, additional annotation, or the amplification of metaphorical expressions that might otherwise remain opaque to non-fans. In this way, subtitles function as a mediating tool that lowers the barrier to entry and, in line with their promotional function, encourages wider audience engagement.<br>
In sum, although both modalities share the general purpose of making the narrative accessible, their differing target readers necessitate divergent strategies. The in-game text privileges immersion for a knowledgeable fanbase, whereas live-stream subtitles prioritise clarity and appeal for broader audiences. Skopos theory provides a principled framework for explaining this divergence by situating translation decisions within the communicative needs of their respective readerships.</p>
<h2>Chapter 4: Case Study (English-Chinese part)</h2>
<p>Building on the typological and theoretical groundwork established in the previous chapter, this section turns to a detailed case study of selected source texts from <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em>. The analysis focuses on how the same textual material is localised under both in-game text and live-stream subtitles, and how their respective Skopos and text types guide the practice of translation.<br>
The discussion is organised into two parts. The first examines shared strategies, i.e. those approaches that operate across both modalities regardless of medium, reflecting common functional requirements such as maintaining narrative coherence or ensuring linguistic naturalness. The second investigates differentiated strategies, where divergences arise due to variations in communicative purpose and target readership.</p>
<h3>4.1 Shared strategies of translating in-game texts and live-stream subtitles</h3>
<h4>4.1.1 Explicitation of logical connectives</h4>
<p>The Chinese language is characterised as a language of parataxis. Chinese tends to use a series of relatively short, independent clauses placed in sequence to form a sentence or a text. This feature renders the connections within Chinese texts more organic and flexible, which means that Chinese readers rely more heavily on context to understand the logical relationships between sentences (Li, 2025:9). Consequently, adding logical connectives that are implicit in the source text can enhance the coherence of the target text during translation. This approach not only aligns more closely with Chinese expressive and reading conventions but also ensures greater fluency and naturalness in the translated text. Through the translation strategy of explicitation of connectives, the cognitive load for both game players and live-stream viewers can be reduced.<br>
The following paragraphs provide a detailed analysis of an example in my practice.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02b1ea16-be89-407c-87c9-bb0e0df8e7f0"><img width="1353" height="486" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02b1ea16-be89-407c-87c9-bb0e0df8e7f0" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 486px;"></a></p>
<p>In example 1 (see Table 1), an NPC named Ruffles were talking about his tragic experiences with Holmes in the World War I. In the source text, the first sentence states the fact that Ruffles’s eye was injured, while the second sentence describes the treatment he received at the hospital and the positive outcome. The shift in emotion is only implicitly conveyed by the context in the source text. Therefore, by adding “幸运的是” (fortunately) in the target text, this turning point and emotional shift are made explicit to the audience. This allows both the players and viewers to immediately feel the change from misfortune to good luck without having to infer the logical connection, which not only aligns with the language habits of the target audience but also improves the text’s fluency and narrative pace, in line with the functional approach emphasised by Skopos Theory.<br>
More importantly, the addition of this logical connective also resonates with the visual elements in the game and the live-stream. As shown in Figure 4, when delivering the first line, Ruffles closes his eyes with a deeply sorrowful expression, reflecting his inner pain. However, his expression turns to one of relief in the second sentence. By explicating the logical relation between the two sentences, the translation allows the dialogue to interact harmoniously with the visual cues on the screen, thereby enhancing the sense of immersion for both players and viewers.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8657a665-8ff5-49a0-8055-d9b1f5622cad"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8657a665-8ff5-49a0-8055-d9b1f5622cad" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;"></a></p>
<p><em>Figure 4: Screenshot of example 1</em></p>
<p>In addition, the translation of the first sentence is also adapted in light of the visual cues. From Ruffles’s portrait in Figure 4, it is evident that he wears an eyepatch over his left eye, confirming that “one eye gone” in the original refers specifically to his left eye. A literal rendering such as “一只眼睛失明，另一只眼睛角膜受损” (one eye is blind, and the other eye’s cornea is damaged) would sound redundant in Chinese. Instead, drawing on the visual information to translate them directly as “左眼彻底失明” (my left eye is completely blind) and “右眼角膜受损” (my right eye’s cornea is damaged) enables the audience to process the plot more quickly and smoothly.</p>
<h4>4.1.2 Explicitation of semantic information</h4>
<p>Similarly, explicating semantic information explicit in the original text can also clarify meanings that would otherwise rely on context or inference, thereby serving the shared purpose of enhancing immersion.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfd5b840-295c-4103-8d93-e3e0e5b2aa48"><img width="1368" height="647" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfd5b840-295c-4103-8d93-e3e0e5b2aa48" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 647px;"></a></p>
<p>Example 2 (see Table 2) presents a dialogue in which Holmes notices Watson reading a mystery novel. As Watson is also writing biographies of Holmes’s cases which can also be classified as mystery novel, Holmes assumes that Watson’s purpose in reading this book is to “familiarise with his competition.” However, a literal translation of this phrase into Chinese such as “熟悉你的比赛” would not only sound unnatural but would also create obstacles to readers’ comprehension. Therefore, in the translation of Holmes’s question, his semantic information is made explicit by adding the clue of “作家同行” (fellow writer) in order to convey the underlying intent of Holmes’s question more clearly.<br>
Then in Watson’s reply, the translation renders “little story” as “推理小说” (mystery novel) further explicating the central topic of the dialogue and clarifying the implication of Holmes’s question, thereby facilitating the reader’s comprehension of the plot development. Moreover, since the previous sentence is a question, the Chinese translation chooses to add a direct response “没有” (no), which strengthens the coherence between the dialogues and ensures greater logical fluency.<br>
In conclusion, this translation ensures that the dialogue remains coherent and readily accessible to the target audience. Adapting the wording to make implicit relations explicit and to enhance logical flow serves the communicative function of the translation, prioritising audience understanding and narrative continuity over literal fidelity to the source text.</p>
<h4>4.1.3 Contextual adaptation</h4>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5633ea2-8560-4172-9767-652c9c7cb930"><img width="1322" height="804" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5633ea2-8560-4172-9767-652c9c7cb930" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 804px;"></a></p>
<p>Example 3 (see Table 3) presents a quarrel between Holmes and a fraudster. In the previous plot, Holmes, by examining Pippi’s so-called “mermaid”, discovered evidence of forgery and deduced that it had been fabricated by stitching together the specimens of a monkey and a fish. Holmes hoped to restore peace to the beach occupied by crowds drawn by Pippi and her mermaid, but her refusal to listen or to leave gradually provoked his anger during their conversation. The emotional shift between the two characters is conveyed through the game’s voice acting, so the dialogue itself should correspond to this change of feeling to enhance immersion. In the source text, their dialogues are almost identical, relying only on slight changes in sentence length and punctuation to suggest a progression of tone. A literal reproduction of this repetition in Chinese would appear rigid and unnatural, lacking the sense of authentic dialogue.<br>
Therefore, in my translation, each line is adapted according to the narrative context. For example, Pippi’s the response “没有就是没有” (I told you didn’t) reinforces her persistence and growing impatience; and her third, “才没有呢!” (I certainly didn’t!) is more colloquial and emotionally charged, showing her outburst. This gradual variation aligns with Chinese colloquial expressions. At the same time, for Holmes’s line is also adapted entirely. The original “Indeed you did” is translated as “证据确凿” (The evidence is conclusive), which can resonate with the preceding scene in which Holmes investigates Pippi’s “mermaid and uncovers evidence of forgery, reinforcing his identity as a detective. And “You did!” was translated as “你撒谎!” to avoid repetition and enhance dramatic tension.<br>
From the perspective of Skopos Theory, this approach fulfils the communicative purpose of the translation by enhancing linguistic naturalness, highlighting characterisation, and supporting narrative development.</p>
<h3>4.2 Different strategies of translating in-game texts and live-stream subtitles</h3>
<h4>4.2.1 Simplification in subtitles</h4>
<p>When comparing in-game text with live-stream subtitles, one of the most obvious differences lies in the restrictions imposed on subtitles by time and space. Subtitles must appear on screen in synchrony with spoken audio, remain visible long enough to be read comfortably, and occupy limited screen space without obscuring key visual elements. Therefore, subtitles must prioritise brevity, legibility, and rhythmical alignment with oral delivery. This means that subtitles need to selectively omit content unrelated to the plot itself to maintain the greatest possible conciseness, which ensures smooth processing and uninterrupted immersion for video viewers.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b491a34d-f6f1-4a52-9af2-ffb324b687e3"><img width="1302" height="927" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b491a34d-f6f1-4a52-9af2-ffb324b687e3" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 927px;"></a></p>
<p>Example 4 is a prompt triggered when the player interacts with the telephone during the investigation stage. In <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em>, in order to prevent players from feeling uncertain about how to advance the storyline and to enhance the smoothness of gameplay, the developer introduced a special function that allows Holmes to contact his brother Mycroft through the telephone in the scene and seek his advice. Mycroft’s suggestions change dynamically according to the player’s progress in the game.<br>
Within the game itself, such prompt plays a crucial functional role because it can indicate possible actions for players to avoid causing confusion. According to Skopos Theory, the communicative purpose of in-game translation is therefore not only to preserve narrative fidelity but also to maintain the usability and playability of the product. For this reason, prompts and operational instructions must be retained to fulfil their purpose.<br>
By contrast, in the context of live-stream subtitles, the audience assumes a very different role. Viewers are not participants in gameplay, and thus do not require operational guidance. The Skopos of the subtitle text is to provide an accessible narrative experience, highlighting plot development rather than procedural accuracy. Accordingly, the translator can omit such prompts if necessary. This reduction serves two functions. First, it can avoid distracting the audience with information irrelevant to their experience. Second, it will lower the reading burden by reducing the volume of subtitle text, thereby preserving immersion in the unfolding story.<br>
In the in-game text of example 4, in order to emphasize the location and function of this telephone, the source text in game specifically highlights “use the telephone” and “when I’m at loss.” In the localisation practice, both elements are retained in order to fulfil their functional purpose. However, in the case of subtitles, such information is unnecessary for the viewers. So these parts are intentionally omitted so as to preserve the brevity of the subtitles.</p>
<h4>4.2.2 Dynamic variation</h4>
<p>In some cases, the dialogues triggered by different in-game interactions are the same. As a result, the in-game translation can only provide a general translation since in programming, one dialogue code can only correspond to one string of text. By contrast, subtitles for live-streams are not bound by this technical limitation. The translator can therefore adapt the same source text in different ways according to the surrounding context and narrative situation, producing variation that feels more natural and expressive.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecfbd780-f00d-45af-bd99-562fbf05345e"><img width="1317" height="1205" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecfbd780-f00d-45af-bd99-562fbf05345e" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 1205px;"></a></p>
<p>Example 5 (see Table 5) appears in the investigation stage at Baker Street. When the player attempts to “converse” with irrelevant items, such as slippers, paintings, or the carpet, Watson would ask whether he is “slightly bored.” Therefore, the same dialogue can be repeatedly triggered in a short span of time within the same scene, and the same dialogue was likewise repeated within less than five minutes in the live-stream. Although the in-game text cannot be altered, the subtitles allow for greater flexibility. To avoid repetition, when the line appeared a second time, I chose to rendered Watson’s question into “are you sure you’re all right”, which both prevented redundancy and subtly suggested a progression in Watson’s emotional state, conveying greater concern the second time he posed the question to Holmes.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cc0a7b6-9a28-4f4c-8b76-589e27a22833"><img width="1320" height="513" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cc0a7b6-9a28-4f4c-8b76-589e27a22833" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 513px;"></a></p>
<p>Similarly, in Example 6 (see Table 6), the live-stream subtitles were adapted in order to create variation between the two identical dialogues and to allow them to integrate more smoothly into the narrative. In the live-stream, the first time Holmes calls the dog Toby it is to take him to the crime scene, while the second time it is to send him home. Accordingly, I adapted the translation in line with the corresponding context.<br>
In conclusion, the Skopos of subtitles is enhancing narrative flow and immersion for viewers, so dynamic variation has the ability to reflect the psychological activities of a character under different contextual situation. Through reducing redundancy, aligning the language more closely with natural conversational patterns, the subtitles can ultimately offer the audience a smoother and more engaging viewing experience.</p>
<h4>4.2.3 Adding annotations in subtitles</h4>
<p><em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> is a game adapted from the Sherlock Holmes series, and therefore some dialogues involve direct references or creative adaptations of the canon. As discussed in Chapter 3, the target readers of the game are mainly those who already possess familiarity with the relevant cultural background. however, the live-stream is intended as a form of promotion, meaning that a significant proportion of its target readers may lack relevant knowledge. Without appropriate explanation, viewers of the live-stream videos may feel confused by the plot and be unable to appreciate the humour in the source text, thereby undermining the purpose of attracting a wider audience.<br>
Since only subtitles can have annotations added, the example below shows only the translation of live-stream subtitles and the corresponding annotation.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0154917d-8ea9-4e10-8ddc-36673d3e5c74"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0154917d-8ea9-4e10-8ddc-36673d3e5c74" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;"></a></p>
<p>In Example 7 (See Table 7), Holmes is talking to an NPC named “Ruffles.” Because the pronunciation of “Raffles” and “Ruffles” is similar, Holmes mistakenly assumes that this NPC is a relative of Raffles the cricketer. To understand the humour underlying this exchange, it is necessary to be aware of a specific cultural background that Raffles was a criminal character created by Conan Doyle’s brother-in-law, who took inspiration from Holmes himself. Since Holmes is a detective who pursues criminals, he ironically remarks that they are “in the same circle.” To assist the audience of live-stream in grasping this allusion, a brief but essential annotation is added to the top right of the screen (see Figure 5), which not only supports comprehension of the scene but also enables interested viewers to seek out further information and expand their knowledge.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0af91934-bf8c-42b5-a644-4812d9567421"><img width="398" height="223" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0af91934-bf8c-42b5-a644-4812d9567421" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 223px;"></a></p>
<p><em>Figure 5: Screenshot of example 7</em></p>
<p>Annotations can contribute to the Skopos of the live-stream by attracting and engaging a wider audience by making the content accessible. However, the coherence rule of Skopos Theory also requires that the translation be easily processable for the target audience. If annotations are overly long or with relevant information, they risk imposing a cognitive burden on viewers, distracting them from the dialogues and plots. For this reason, annotations must remain concise, offering only the essential cultural or contextual information.</p>
<h4>4.2.4 Synchronisation of subtitles</h4>
<p>Subtitles are required to remain closely synchronised with the accompanying audio, as they must appear and disappear in tandem with the spoken dialogue. This temporal constraint means that long or complex sentences in the source text cannot always be transferred directly into the target text without risking a mismatch between reading time and speech rhythm. To address this, translators often reformulate or restructure longer sentences in line with the pauses and intonation patterns of the voice acting. Such adaptation not only maintains synchrony but also ensures that the subtitles can be read comfortably within the limited time available, thereby preserving both comprehensibility and immersion for the audience.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adf44f5f-0519-4bbb-9c30-ff5266968919"><img width="1299" height="999" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adf44f5f-0519-4bbb-9c30-ff5266968919" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 999px;"></a></p>
<p>In example 8 (see Table 8), Holmes makes an impossible request of his housekeeper Martha, which makes her quite agitated. To convey her impatience and anger, the in-game voice acting is delivered at a very rapid pace with only one pauses after “drop everything”. So, the subtitles not only should the wording be reduced in length to accommodate the speed of delivery, but the frequency of punctuation-based segmentation also needs to be minimised. By doing so, the rhythm of the subtitles can better align with the rapid speech, thereby reinforcing the emotional intensity of the scene.<br>
In this example, the source text contains multiple clauses joined in sequence, reflecting Martha’s frustration at Holmes’s unreasonable demand. If translated literally into Chinese, the subtitles would be too lengthy for comfortable reading within the limited time available on screen, and the frequent pauses marked by commas in English would make synchronisation with the rapid delivery of the voice acting difficult. Therefore, the multiple procedural steps of “drop everything, go to the shops, acquire additional food” are adapted into a metaphorical expression “就算我是魔法师” (even if I were a magician), which conveys impossibility in a more vivid and simple way. This strategy not only shortens the subtitle to suit the fast-paced delivery but also successfully recreates the pauses in the source text, thereby better matching the rhythm of the audio performance. At the same time, the figurative phrasing intensifies Martha’s emotional state by highlighting her exasperation in a culturally natural and emphatic manner.</p>
<h4>4.2.5 Audience-oriented adaptations</h4>
<p>The same source text may yield different translations in the contexts of in-game dialogue and live-stream subtitles because of the distinct functions and communicative environments of the two media. In-game text is closely tied to interactivity: it must respond to player actions, provide operational clarity, and maintain immersion within the flow of gameplay. Subtitles, by contrast, are designed for a viewing audience who are not active participants but observers. Therefore, when translating subtitles, it is often necessary to explain and supplement the conditions and objects that trigger the dialogue. As a result, the Skopos of each medium diverges, and this divergence naturally leads to variation in translation strategies. What appears redundant or distracting in a subtitle may be essential in the game, and what is immersive in gameplay may be confusing for viewers without contextual cues. So, recognising these differing communicative purposes of their audience is crucial to understanding why identical source text is rendered differently across the two media.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd13a4d5-3265-4c96-bd64-c191b3d52748"><img width="1305" height="590" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd13a4d5-3265-4c96-bd64-c191b3d52748" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 590px;"></a></p>
<p>In example 9 (see Table 9), the same source text is translated differently in the game and in the live-stream subtitles. After Watson’s leg injury, if Holmes interacts with his leg by pressing the “Examine” button, this dialogue will be triggered.<br>
In the in-game localisation, Waston’s first sentence is simplified as “别动” (Stop). This is because the players are directly engaged in the interaction that triggers this response, and they are already aware of what action has been performed. Thus, the translation does not need to repeat or clarify the content of interaction. A shorter and more direct form such as “别动” can reinforce immediacy, and strengthens immersion by aligning with the player’s embodied experience.<br>
In contrast, the live-stream audience does not share the player’s interactive perspective and may not immediately understand why Watson suddenly protests if they didn’t notice the previous action in the video. To avoid potential confusion, the subtitles choose to make the object explicit by specifying both the object and the content of this action, and translated it as “别折腾我的腿了” (stop messing with my leg). By pointing out “the leg,” the subtitles provide viewers with sufficient information to grasp the cause of Watson’s reaction, thereby ensuring narrative clarity.<br>
Audience-oriented adaptations highlight the principle that the same line of source text may require divergent treatments depending on the audience’s role and perspective. In-game text prioritises immersion and logical coherence within interactive gameplay, while live-stream subtitles prioritise accessibility and comprehension for non-participatory viewers. Their divergent Skopos therefore demonstrate the translator’s ability to align with the communicative purpose of each medium.</p>
<h2>Chapter 5: Conclusion and Insights</h2>
<p>Through the translation practice of <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em>, the translator has learned and accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience about the process of game localisation and subtitling. What’s more, the translator have also identified some issues that both industry professionals and game developers often overlook, which may impact localisation quality.</p>
<h3>5.1 Conclusion</h3>
<p>This report has explored the distinctive challenges and strategies involved in translating <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> across two different media: in-game text and live-stream subtitles.<br>
Through practice and analysis, it can be found that Skopos Theory plays a guiding role in video game localisation. The game itself is a purposeful communicative behaviour. Different types of games have different purposes, and different types of text in a game also have different functions and purposes (Fang, 2016:103-108). Therefore, when translating video games, it is necessary to help players from different cultural backgrounds have the same game experience by following three rules of Skopos Theory. Only by meeting players’ demands and expectations for the game text can a game be recognised by target players and succeed in the international market.<br>
The comparison between in-game text and live-stream subtitles revealed that the difference in Skopos and readership fundamentally accounts for divergent translation solutions. In-game translation must prioritise functional clarity, immersion, and consistency. Subtitles, by contrast, must accommodate constraints of time and space, synchronise with voice acting, and remain accessible to a broader audience who may lack prior cultural knowledge. As such, subtitles often involve reduction for readability, explicitation to clarify implicit meaning and logical connectives, variation to avoid monotony, and annotations to bridge cultural gaps. The application of Skopos Theory has provided a unifying framework to explain these strategies. The analysis has shown that the functional purpose of each medium determines the appropriate translation choices: coherence and usability for players, clarity and narrative flow for viewers.<br>
Finally, this study argues that game localisation and live-stream subtitling need be approached with different translation strategies tailored for respective readerships, even when they derive from the same source text. Instead, translators must remain responsive to the communicative purpose, technical constraints, and audience expectations of different medium.</p>
<h3>5.2 Insights</h3>
<p>One key insight that emerged from this project relates to the technical challenges of working with the dedicated translation editor provided by the AGS game engine. During the translation process, it became clear that the software is far from user-friendly. The editor can only organise text according to the numerical codes assigned to each string in the programme, rather than presenting dialogue in its narrative sequence. As a result, all lines appear in a fragmented and disordered fashion, making it extremely difficult for the translator to reconstruct the precise context in which each utterance occurs. This lack of contextual information creates a significant risk of misunderstanding the intended meaning or tone of dialogue, which in turn may compromise the accuracy and coherence of the translation. More importantly, such issues could have direct consequences for quality assurance and for the eventual release of the localised game. This highlights the need for more translator-oriented tools in game localisation, where contextual awareness is essential to producing accurate, natural, and immersive translations.<br>
The second insight concerns the role of the translator in the practice of game localisation. Rather than remaining a passive recipient of tasks, the translator should exercise agency and actively contribute to the success of the project. This means not only carrying out the whole process of translation and localisation, but also engaging with the broader communicative and promotional goals of the product itself. For instance, in this project, the translator proposed to the developers the idea of producing a live-stream video as a promotional strategy. Furthermore, during the subtitling process, the translator modified the translation to the knowledge and cultural background of Chinese audiences by adding concise annotations and supplementary information where necessary. These interventions proved highly effective in enhancing the promotional impact of the live-stream and demonstrated the value of a translator’s initiative in shaping the reception of a localised game.</p>
