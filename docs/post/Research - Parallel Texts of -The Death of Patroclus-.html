<meta name="description" content="# Comparison of English Translations from Latin in Homeric and Virgilian Epic

> [!NOTE]
> By comparing **parallel texts of English translations of the same event - The death of Patroclus** from the original Latin, it can be seen that there are aesthetic differences between individualism and tragedy in Homeric and Virgilian Epic. It discusses the Virgilian paradox, an epic of drama and pathos that goes back to the origins of modern debate on Virgil in the Romantic period, where the supposed **natural primitivism and fresh naivete of Homer** was commonly and unfavourably contrasted with the **more artificial and sophisticated Virgilian epic**. 
> <br/>
> It argues that Virgil too sensed from the beginning that the naturalness and noble simplicity of Homer was essentially irrecoverable in the cultural context of the first century BC, but that he had the opportunity to create a Homer for his own times. It also charts the quintessential ambiguity of the Aeneid, both reflecting the **traditionally nationalistic ideology of Roman epic in the steps of Naevius and Ennius**, and **showing an extraordinary empathy with the focalisations and feelings of individual characters**, many of whom represent a point of view at odds with the direction of the nationalistic plot.

IL.16.751   He spoke so, and strode against the [hero](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3383) Kebriones
[IL.16.752](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16752)   with the [spring](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=5082) of a [lion](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3780), who as he ravages the [pastures](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=4259)

IL.16.754   So in your [fury](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3048) you pounced, Patroklos, above Kebriones.
[IL.16.755](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16755)   On the other [side](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=4896) Hektor sprang to the [ground](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3208) from his [chariot](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=2044),
[IL.16.756](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16756)   and the two fought it out over Kebriones, like [lions](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3783)
[IL.16.757](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16757)   who in the [high places](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=1060) of a [mountain](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=4036), both in [huge](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3493) [courage](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=2256)

[IL.16.762](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16762)   since Hektor had caught him by the [head](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3309), and would not let go of him,
[IL.16.763](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16763)   and Patroklos had his [foot](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=2960) on the other [side](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=4896), while the other

[IL.16.791](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16791)   and stood behind him, and struck his back and his [broad](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=1923) [shoulders](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=4879)

## The death of Pallas: Virgil, _Aeneid_ 10.439–509


Meanwhile the kind nymph sent her brother Turnus 
To Lausus’ aid. He sped his chariot 				
Through the line and told his comrades, “Now stand down. 
Pallas belongs to me. I’ll go for him. 
I only wish his father could look on.” 
He spoke. His comrades quit the field as ordered. 
With the Rutulians gone, the youth, transfixed 		
By the haughty orders, let his hard gaze rove 
From a distance over Turnus’ massive form. 
He gave this answer to the tyrant’s words: 
“Either’s a glorious prize: a general’s armor 
Or death. It makes no difference to my father. 		
So stop your threats.” He stepped into the open, 
Freezing the blood in the Arcadians’ hearts. 
Turnus jumped down and closed in on his prey 
On foot. A lion on his lofty post 
Sees a bull lunging on a distant plain 		     	                                            
And hurtles toward him: Turnus looked like this. 
Pallas first gauged his spear’s range, then stepped forward, 
Calling on the huge sky in hope that chance 
Would bless his bravery against the odds. 
“Hercules, come—my father took you in, 			                                    
A stranger—help in this great enterprise. 
Let dying Turnus see his bloody weapons 
Taken from him by my victorious hands.” 
The god heard, but he stifled heavy groans 
In his heart; the tears were futile that he shed. 		                                   
To comfort him, his father, Jupiter, 
Said this: “An end is set for everyone, 
For life is brief and cannot be recovered. 
But brave men, through their exploits, strive for fame 
That lasts. Beneath Troy’s high walls many sons 		                                   
Of gods died. My own child Sarpedon died there.
Fate calls: for Turnus too the race is ending.” 
He turned his eyes away from Italy’s fields. 
Pallas with all his great strength cast his spear 
And snatched his bright sword from the hollow sheath. 	                           
The spear flew, pierced the layers of the shield, 
And struck the breastplate at the shoulder’s rim, 
Finally grazing Turnus’ massive form. 
But he in turn deliberately aimed 
His iron-pointed pike and launched it, saying, 		                                   
“See if my weapon is the one to stick.
The spearhead, striking, shaking, pounded through 
The shield—all of the bronze and iron sheets, 
All of the bull-hide layers wrapping it— 
Into the breastplate, into that strong chest. 			                                   
Out of the wound he tore the heated shaft, 
But with it came his lifeblood and his soul. 
Collapsing forward with a crash of arms, 
He touched the enemy earth with gory lips. 
Turnus stood over him: 					                                                  
“Go tell Evander this, Arcadians: 
I send him back the Pallas he deserves. 
The soothing tribute of a burial I grant him. 
But he had a costly guest— Aeneas.” 
With his foot he held the corpse down 			                                          
And stripped the giant swordbelt with its story  
Of crime etched in—a wedding night that left 
The bedrooms smeared with gore of slaughtered youths— 
That Clonus, son of Eurytus, had embossed 
In gold, and Turnus now was thrilled to loot. 			                         
People know nothing of their fated future. 
Their exaltation cannot stay in bounds. 
The time would come when he’d give anything 
Not to have touched the boy. He’d hate his plunder, 
And hate this day. Pallas’ friends pressed in, wailing. 	                                 
They laid him on his shield to haul away.
What grief, what glory you will take your father! 
A single day brought war and death to you. 
But see the heaps of enemy dead you leave.

Abstract: In this study I shall try to indicate how Vergil has in fact incorporated the whole Iliad and the whole Odyssey into the Aeneid, incomparably transforming the Homeric epics. I must start with a few methodological considerations. I shall then seek to explain the relation of some of the most important passages of the Aeneid to their Homeric counterparts. Finally I shall try to suggest how we ought to understand this grand poetical contest.

> [!NOTE]
> By comparing **parallel texts of English translations of the same event - The death of Patroclus** from the original Latin, it can be seen that there are aesthetic differences between individualism and tragedy in Homeric and Virgilian Epic. It discusses the Virgilian paradox, an epic of drama and pathos that goes back to the origins of modern debate on Virgil in the Romantic period, where the supposed **natural primitivism and fresh naivete of Homer** was commonly and unfavourably contrasted with the **more artificial and sophisticated Virgilian epic**. 
> <br/>
> It argues that Virgil too sensed from the beginning that the naturalness and noble simplicity of Homer was essentially irrecoverable in the cultural context of the first century BC, but that he had the opportunity to create a Homer for his own times. It also charts the quintessential ambiguity of the Aeneid, both reflecting the **traditionally nationalistic ideology of Roman epic in the steps of Naevius and Ennius**, and **showing an extraordinary empathy with the focalisations and feelings of individual characters**, many of whom represent a point of view at odds with the direction of the nationalistic plot.

## The death of Pallas: Virgil, _Aeneid_ 10.439–509


Meanwhile the kind nymph sent her brother Turnus 
To Lausus’ aid. He sped his chariot 				
Through the line and told his comrades, “Now stand down. 
Pallas belongs to me. I’ll go for him. 
I only wish his father could look on.” 
He spoke. His comrades quit the field as ordered. 
With the Rutulians gone, the youth, transfixed 		
By the haughty orders, let his hard gaze rove 
From a distance over Turnus’ massive form. 
He gave this answer to the tyrant’s words: 
“Either’s a glorious prize: a general’s armor 
Or death. It makes no difference to my father. 		
So stop your threats.” He stepped into the open, 
Freezing the blood in the Arcadians’ hearts. 
Turnus jumped down and closed in on his prey 
On foot. A lion on his lofty post 
Sees a bull lunging on a distant plain 		     	                                            
And hurtles toward him: Turnus looked like this. 
Pallas first gauged his spear’s range, then stepped forward, 
Calling on the huge sky in hope that chance 
Would bless his bravery against the odds. 
“Hercules, come—my father took you in, 			                                    
A stranger—help in this great enterprise. 
Let dying Turnus see his bloody weapons 
Taken from him by my victorious hands.” 
The god heard, but he stifled heavy groans 
In his heart; the tears were futile that he shed. 		                                   
To comfort him, his father, Jupiter, 
Said this: “An end is set for everyone, 
For life is brief and cannot be recovered. 
But brave men, through their exploits, strive for fame 
That lasts. Beneath Troy’s high walls many sons 		                                   
Of gods died. My own child Sarpedon died there.
Fate calls: for Turnus too the race is ending.” 
He turned his eyes away from Italy’s fields. 
Pallas with all his great strength cast his spear 
And snatched his bright sword from the hollow sheath. 	                           
The spear flew, pierced the layers of the shield, 
And struck the breastplate at the shoulder’s rim, 
Finally grazing Turnus’ massive form. 
But he in turn deliberately aimed 
His iron-pointed pike and launched it, saying, 		                                   
“See if my weapon is the one to stick.
The spearhead, striking, shaking, pounded through 
The shield—all of the bronze and iron sheets, 
All of the bull-hide layers wrapping it— 
Into the breastplate, into that strong chest. 			                                   
Out of the wound he tore the heated shaft, 
But with it came his lifeblood and his soul. 
Collapsing forward with a crash of arms, 
He touched the enemy earth with gory lips. 
Turnus stood over him: 					                                                  
“Go tell Evander this, Arcadians: 
I send him back the Pallas he deserves. 
The soothing tribute of a burial I grant him. 
But he had a costly guest— Aeneas.” 
With his foot he held the corpse down 			                                          
And stripped the giant swordbelt with its story  
Of crime etched in—a wedding night that left 
The bedrooms smeared with gore of slaughtered youths— 
That Clonus, son of Eurytus, had embossed 
In gold, and Turnus now was thrilled to loot. 			                         
People know nothing of their fated future. 
Their exaltation cannot stay in bounds. 
The time would come when he’d give anything 
Not to have touched the boy. He’d hate his plunder, 
And hate this day. Pallas’ friends pressed in, wailing. 	                                 
They laid him on his shield to haul away.
What grief, what glory you will take your father! 
A single day brought war and death to you. 
But see the heaps of enemy dead you leave.

### _Bibliography_

The most relevant piece for our session is Ch. 1 of [Barchiesi 2015](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvkc7) (on JSTOR) ‘THE DEATH OF PALLAS. Intertextuality and Transformation of the Epic Model
(pp. 1-34)’. This will be particularly relevant to the primary text case study which we shall discuss.  [Conte 2007](https://oxford-universitypressscholarship-com.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199287017.001.0001/acprof-9780199287017) (which is set as a separate reading group activity) is very informative and stimulating on the more general picture of Virgil’s relationship with Homer.

Abstract: In this study I shall try to indicate how Vergil has in fact incorporated the whole Iliad and the whole Odyssey into the Aeneid, incomparably transforming the Homeric epics. I must start with a few methodological considerations. I shall then seek to explain the relation of some of the most important passages of the Aeneid to their Homeric counterparts. Finally I shall try to suggest how we ought to understand this grand poetical contest.

It discusses the Virgilian paradox, an epic of drama and pathos that goes back to the origins of modern debate on Virgil in the Romantic period, where the supposed <strong>natural primitivism and fresh naivete of Homer</strong> was commonly and unfavourably contrasted with the <strong>more artificial and sophisticated Virgilian epic</strong>.<br>
<br><br>
It argues that Virgil too sensed from the beginning that the naturalness and noble simplicity of Homer was essentially irrecoverable in the cultural context of the first century BC, but that he had the opportunity to create a Homer for his own times. It also charts the quintessential ambiguity of the Aeneid, both reflecting the <strong>traditionally nationalistic ideology of Roman epic in the steps of Naevius and Ennius</strong>, and <strong>showing an extraordinary empathy with the focalisations and feelings of individual characters</strong>, many of whom represent a point of view at odds with the direction of the nationalistic plot.</p>

<br>
<h2>The death of Pallas: Virgil, <em>Aeneid</em> 10.439–509</h2>
<p>Meanwhile the kind nymph sent her brother Turnus<br>
To Lausus’ aid. He sped his chariot<br>
Through the line and told his comrades, “Now stand down.<br>
Pallas belongs to me. I’ll go for him.<br>
I only wish his father could look on.”<br>
He spoke. His comrades quit the field as ordered.<br>
With the Rutulians gone, the youth, transfixed<br>
By the haughty orders, let his hard gaze rove<br>
From a distance over Turnus’ massive form.<br>
He gave this answer to the tyrant’s words:<br>
“Either’s a glorious prize: a general’s armor<br>
Or death. It makes no difference to my father.<br>
So stop your threats.” He stepped into the open,<br>
Freezing the blood in the Arcadians’ hearts.<br>
Turnus jumped down and closed in on his prey<br>
On foot. A lion on his lofty post<br>
Sees a bull lunging on a distant plain<br>
And hurtles toward him: Turnus looked like this.<br>
Pallas first gauged his spear’s range, then stepped forward,<br>
Calling on the huge sky in hope that chance<br>
Would bless his bravery against the odds.<br>
“Hercules, come—my father took you in,<br>
A stranger—help in this great enterprise.<br>
Let dying Turnus see his bloody weapons<br>
Taken from him by my victorious hands.”<br>
The god heard, but he stifled heavy groans<br>
In his heart; the tears were futile that he shed.<br>
To comfort him, his father, Jupiter,<br>
Said this: “An end is set for everyone,<br>
For life is brief and cannot be recovered.<br>
But brave men, through their exploits, strive for fame<br>
That lasts. Beneath Troy’s high walls many sons<br>
Of gods died. My own child Sarpedon died there.<br>
Fate calls: for Turnus too the race is ending.”<br>
He turned his eyes away from Italy’s fields.<br>
Pallas with all his great strength cast his spear<br>
And snatched his bright sword from the hollow sheath.<br>
The spear flew, pierced the layers of the shield,<br>
And struck the breastplate at the shoulder’s rim,<br>
Finally grazing Turnus’ massive form.<br>
But he in turn deliberately aimed<br>
His iron-pointed pike and launched it, saying,<br>
“See if my weapon is the one to stick.<br>
The spearhead, striking, shaking, pounded through<br>
The shield—all of the bronze and iron sheets,<br>
All of the bull-hide layers wrapping it—<br>
Into the breastplate, into that strong chest.<br>
Out of the wound he tore the heated shaft,<br>
But with it came his lifeblood and his soul.<br>
Collapsing forward with a crash of arms,<br>
He touched the enemy earth with gory lips.<br>
Turnus stood over him:<br>
“Go tell Evander this, Arcadians:<br>
I send him back the Pallas he deserves.<br>
The soothing tribute of a burial I grant him.<br>
But he had a costly guest— Aeneas.”<br>
With his foot he held the corpse down<br>
And stripped the giant swordbelt with its story<br>
Of crime etched in—a wedding night that left<br>
The bedrooms smeared with gore of slaughtered youths—<br>
That Clonus, son of Eurytus, had embossed<br>
In gold, and Turnus now was thrilled to loot.<br>
People know nothing of their fated future.<br>
Their exaltation cannot stay in bounds.<br>
The time would come when he’d give anything<br>
Not to have touched the boy. He’d hate his plunder,<br>
And hate this day. Pallas’ friends pressed in, wailing.<br>
They laid him on his shield to haul away.<br>
What grief, what glory you will take your father!<br>
A single day brought war and death to you.<br>
But see the heaps of enemy dead you leave.</p>

Abstract: In this study I shall try to indicate how Vergil has in fact incorporated the whole Iliad and the whole Odyssey into the Aeneid, incomparably transforming the Homeric epics. I must start with a few methodological considerations. I shall then seek to explain the relation of some of the most important passages of the Aeneid to their Homeric counterparts. Finally I shall try to suggest how we ought to understand this grand poetical contest.<br>
