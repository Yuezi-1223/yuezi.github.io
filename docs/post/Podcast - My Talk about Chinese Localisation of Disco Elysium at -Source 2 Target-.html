## Introduction 
　 _Disco Elysium_ is a groundbreaking role-playing game (RPG) developed by an Estonian studio named ZA/UM. Upon release in 2019, the game has caused a sensation by winning multiple industry-recognized and prestigious awards as a debut work of an unknown independent studio, including Best Narrative and Best Role-Playing Game at **The Game Awards (TGA) 2019[1]**. Set in an imaginative war-torn city of Revachol, players assume the role of an amnesiac detective tasked with solving a murder with limited time and various restrictions.
　On game design, _Disco Elysium_ is widely recognized for its unconventional approach and its exceptional use of language. (Robertson, 2024) Rather than relying on traditional RPG mechanics like combat or leveling through enemies, there are only two core gameplay mechanics: first, manipulating the protagonist to engage in rich and dense dialogues with the game characters and also himself to uncover the truth behind the murder and the whole world-setting; and second, making critical decisions at key plot junctures only via highly randomized results of cyber dice rolls. These designs reflect the game’s strong emphasis on narratology over ludology, with the former seeing games as narratives and representations, the latter focusing on the play action dimensions of games (O’Hagan & Mangiron, 2013).
　Intertextuality, which referred to the text construction as a mosaic of quotations, absorption and transformation from other texts (Kristeva, 1986) is also another important feature of this game. Recently, intertextuality also became an ever-present phenomenon in video games to connect to real history, literature, philosophy, and other media (Duret, 2017). The fundamental framework and the game stage design in _Disco Elysium_ drew extensive references to real-world historical and political events, such as the French Revolution, the communist Soviet Union, and the political upheavals in Eastern Europe. It also incorporates a wide range of political-philosophical ideologies as undertones of the game, including capitalism, communism, liberalism, imperialism, moralism, and fascism etc. Therefore, the magical realist style of game-setting, combined with its rich and sophisticated ideological undertones, further elevates the level of interpretive complexity for players. 
　Besides, the game language is also complicated, florid, philosophical, and often poetic—drawing comparisons to literary fiction rather than standard video game writing. Such game language also poses challenges for players. Non-native English speakers, in particular, have noted the difficulty in navigating the game's extensive vocabulary and nuanced dialogues. One player remarked on Reddit, “I had to take my time and re-read entire sentences three, four times sometimes”. Similarly, a discussion on Steam highlighted that even players from English-speaking countries found themselves consulting dictionaries to fully grasp the text. 
　Despite the considerable challenges posed by the game's complexity in both the understanding and language of the game, the localisation team of WhisperGames delivered a successful Chinese localisation that received overall positive comments by players across major Chinese gamer online platforms such as GCORES, the NGA forum, and the review section on the Steam platform. **Comments consistently praised the translation for its fluency, clarity, accuracy, and stylistic elegance—clearly distinguishing it from machine translation[2]**.  Players have also expressed appreciation for the localisation team’s outstanding work, which enabled them to access and engage with such a textually dense and conceptually challenging game, but which possesses ideological depth and narrative quality. Completing such a huge localisation project of over one million words within four months is also considered as a remarkable achievement in the field of English-Chinese game localisation. But unfortunately, certain loss in the Chinese localisation of _Disco Elysium_ still prevails due to cultural and linguistic reasons.
　In the following two sections, I will give several representative examples to illustrate the inevitable loss and sophisticated creation in the process of game localisation. Because of technical issues, i.e. unable to conduct text extraction and frequency analysis for the game texts with over one million words, the essay will mainly adopt a qualitative approach.

## Inevitable loss in _Disco Elysium_ Chinese localisation
　It is commonplace that something is always lost in translation. Early theorists acknowledged that no translation can perfectly replicate all aspects of the original. Eugene Nida (1975) noted that “all types of translation involve (1) loss of information, (2) addition of information, and/or (3) skewing of information”. Catford (1965) defined untranslatability through two aspects: linguistic and cultural, where the failure to find a target language (TL) equivalent lies either in the linguistic differences between the source language (SL) and target language, or in the absence of a functionally relevant feature in the SL. Therefore, wordplays, idioms, local customs and institutions in the ST often cause barriers to the transformation into the target language, which is also the case in game localisation.
　However, the case for _Disco Elysium_ is slightly different. The most prominent loss during the localisation will be the lingual diversity in the original game language. The intonations that manifested in certain language itself, the pragmatic information they convey and the associations they raise are culturally marked, just as Venuti (2004) put it, “Social and regional dialects, ..., and foreign borrowings tend to be language-specific, unlikely to travel well, their peculiar force difficult to render into other languages.” Therefore, in game localisation practices, geographical dialects are generally neutralized in translation (Mangiron 2007), resulting in inevitable loss in translation process. 
　_Disco Elysium_ was originally produced and released exclusively in English; however, it features a significant presence of other foreign languages such as French, Spanish, Italian, and Finnish, embedded throughout the game via both voice acting and textual elements. **For native English-speaking players, this multilingualism is easily perceptible[3]**, allowing players to have direct preservations of diverse origins of the game characters. Besides, discussions of the function and representation of the non-English contents have also been stimulated in the game community. These discussions often revolve around how the game took references of the countries in real world speaking these languages—such as the **French Revolution[4]**, which not only enriched the understanding to the game, but also created opportunities for exchanges outside the gameplay that in turn enrich the gaming experience. In contrast, during the localisation process into Chinese, such linguistic diversity was erased. For Chinese players who lack proficiency in English or other foreign languages, it became difficult to detect the game’s multilingual nature therefore to intuitively grasp the nature of the fictional setting of the game as a turbulent melting pot. As a result, they may miss out on the layered cultural complexity that English-speaking players experience more directly. 
　Moreover, the non-English languages in the game also caused difficulty or even impossibility to transfer puns generated through the multilinguilism of the game into Chinese. One such example is the translation about a character’s name: “Call Me Mañana” is translated to “叫我马列拉”. In the Chinese translation, the localisation team transliterated the name “Mañana” to “马列拉”, rendering “call me” as “call me by the name of (叫我)”, which is straightforward. However, the Spanish word mañana also means “tomorrow,” allowing players who are familiar with Spanish to interpret it as a potential pun when considered alongside the character’s identity and personality. This character is portrayed as a laid-back, philosophically inclined dockworker who is notably unmotivated to work. If we keep the original meaning of “mañana” in Spanish and interpret “call me” not as a name introduction but as a request for “give me a call,” the entire phrase could be reinterpreted as “Call me tomorrow.” This alternative reading cleverly aligns with the character’s lazy, procrastinatory characteristics, adding a layer of humor and playful implication like “Don’t bother me today. Call me tomorrow”. 
　Although the game’s creators have not explicitly confirmed whether this name was intended as a pun, such player-driven interpretation enriches the comedic dimension and enhances the overall engagement of players with the game. Unfortunately, this kind of linguistic playfulness is lost in the Chinese transliteration, although being the most authoritive  and conventional approach in translation of foreign names or appellations in Chinese (Xu 2024), which is a regrettable limitation for failing to convey the cross-linguistic nuance and humor within the game.

## Examples of widely praised transcreation in Disco Elysium
　As an emerging type of translation, video game localisation is beyond simply translating on-screen text. It is a user-centered type of translation that can be framed within functionalist paradigms of translation, whereby the translation process is shaped by the intended purpose or function of the target text (Nord 1997). The main goal of game localisation is to create a functional localised version with a similar look and feel as the original game that produces a similar effect on target players, as if it were a game originally developed for them (O’Hagan & Mangiron 2006). Therefore, the localisation decisions often depend on a new set of user environments with specific linguistic, cultural, and technical implications. (O’Hagan & Mangiron, 2013), which allows game localizers to enjoy a degree of creative freedom far beyond that of other translators. Thus, the term of “transcreation” holds important position in game translation, highlighting that translators are empowered to modify, omit, or add elements to enhance player enjoyment (ibid). The localisation team sometimes even invented lines that didn’t exist in the source texts – effectively a new literary creation – to elicit the intended player reaction. This can be seen as a loss of the original reference, but a gain in audience connection, especially under the context of prioritizing the equivalence of player experience after the transition of game language. 
　There are many exemplary cases of successful transcreation in the Chinese localisation of _Disco Elysium_. For example, the localisation of the names of two non-playable characters (NPCs) in the game—portrayed as young, offbeat hooligans with vulgar speaking style—has been widely appreciated by Chinese players for its humorous and inventive adaptation with a doggerel style. A table chart is provided below to show the source text (ST), the translation, and the back translation (BT) of the Chinese translation with clarity. 
<img width='1203' height='207' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04c003f0-1504-4f25-b8af-7c37da6c884b' />
　It can be said that the typographical choice of employing capitalization in the original English texts not only distinguishes them from ordinary vulgar lines but rather to be character identifiers, it also foreshadows the uniqueness of the ensuing scene—the exchange between the protagonist and the two young hooligans is quite engaging and humorous in the game.
However, the Chinese localisation went even further, not only incorporating elements of the target culture but also enhancing the original text’s literary quality and humor. In fact, it is hard to produce a back translation that fully captures the creative adaptation achieved by the Chinese localisation in its native linguistic and cultural context. Firstly, the Chinese localisation of these two relatively simple English names were substantially expanded, incorporating several new meanings that absent from the original. Each translation begins with a four-character idiom, adding a literary feature to the translation while establishing a parallel structure between the two translations. This stylistic embellishment does not conflict with the characters’ personas; on the contrary, it may reflect a subcultural tendency toward exaggerated, non-mainstream behavior of street thugs, for they may flaunt a kind of pseudo-literary flair. 
　Moreover, the translation mitigates the offensiveness of the original’s blunt vulgarities, which aligns more to the stricter censorship in Chinese market. For example, “fuck” is translated as “干翻,” which is a more moderated rendering in Chinese, while “PISS” is humorously transformed into “取一尿饮 (take a sip of piss)”, further enriching the line with vividity and playfulness. The cumulative effect of these skillful choices significantly enhances the humor and entertainment value of the translation—arguably even surpassing the original, achieving the “emotional localisation” that facilitates target players’ immersion in the game (Díaz Montón, 2010, qtd. in Mangiron, 2016). The localized character names have been widely praised by Chinese players, frequently mentioned in scattered online posts discussing the game’s localisation quality. Such positive receptions reflect the success of this transcreation, which left a deep impression on the players and stands as a testament to the translator’s creativity and cultural sensitivity. 
<br/>
　Except from the above example, there is another example of a successful transcreation in _Disco Elysium_’s Chinese localisation, with the in-game context provided below. The lines in italic in both ST and translation are corresponding that analysis will be conducted.

<img width='1376' height='483' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03319191-00b8-4048-808b-da04854d5d16' />

　In this part of the story, a group of young people aspiring to build an anodic music club within an abandoned church helped a programmer to use their sound equipment for her experiment. The original line of the character EGGHEAD was rich in rhetorical devices, utilizing both alliterations to amplify its sound and rhythm, and parallel structure to reinforce its thematic emphasis. These stylistic elements, however, pose significant challenges for translators to preserve both the rhetorical form and humorous elements of the original.
　The translation of “Pump it to the brick, pump it to the hard master!” was produced largely out of creation, with references to lyrics of one popular Chinese rap song: “野狼Disco (Wild Wolf Disco)” Released in 2019, the song quickly went virus online due to its catchy rhythm, humorous lyrics, and unique musical style. The widespread popularity of this track was also proved by its performances on major stages, including the CCTV Spring Festival Gala. 
　Under the background of the widespread popularity of the song “Wild Wolf Disco” during the same year (2019) of the localisation work, and in consideration of the thematic similarity between the anodic music and Wild Wolf Disco—both being popular and novel among the youth, the localisation team creatively adapted a line from the song’s iconic chorus. The original lyrics—“左手” (on your left) and “右手” (on your right)—form a parallel structure that mirrors the rhetorical techniques of the English source text. The translators also paid attention to preserving the meaning reference in the original source while localizing it in a culturally resonant manner. they added the word “硬核” (hardcore), a concept central to both anodic music in game and EGGHEAD’s character on the lyrical foundation. This localized version has since become one of the most prominent and memorable examples of transcreation in _Disco Elysium_ among Chinese players. It is still frequently mentioned in online discussions by new players today, who express a sense of surprise and cultural intimacy upon encountering a familiar cultural element after reading the game’s otherwise dense and stream-of-consciousness texts. This is a good example echoing to Alvarenga’s (2019) highlights of the significance of linguistic fluency and cultural familiarity in enhancing player immersion through localisation, which plays a critical role in videogames, being responsible for making them positively memorable and offering a unique experience. 
　However, the author would also like to raise the question of whether such a high degree of transcreation leads only to positive influence. In the example discussed above, it becomes apparent that the use of parallel structure in the original ST was intended to convey a clear response to SOONA, THE PROGRAMMER’s question: namely, “yes and turn the volume all the way up!” This core meaning, however, is not explicitly preserved in the transcreated version, failing to the deliver basic mission of translation of “conveying meanings”. Moreover, the translator’s choice to adapt this song lyrics also implicitly assigns a specific characterization to the “anodic music” in the game, which may not be entirely appropriate or consistent with the original. The ambiguous and stream-of-consciousness narrative style in_Disco Elysium_ leaves considerable room for free interpretation of players, which only associated the anodic music to generalized adjective like “love” and “hardcore”. The fixed cultural tone and stylistic qualities of “Wild Wolf Disco” may not fully align with the open and abstract nature of anodic music as originally portrayed.
　In this case, it seems that sometimes the transcreation or adaptation in game localisation may tend to an extreme extent, posing impact on the gameplay experience by breaking the suspension of disbelief of game players. It is important to for the translator to bear in mind “the unavoidable release of meanings that work only in the translating language” (Venuti 2004), and make more cautious and contemplated decisions.

## Conclusion 
　Video game localizers operate on a creative tightrope, where every choice simultaneously incurs a loss and offers a potential gain. On one side lies the ineffable: the untranslatable cultural essences, the rhetorical devices like jokes and puns, the historically bound meanings that inevitably slip away in another language. On the other side lies the inventive spark: the translator’s ability to bring a new life into a text, to craft a work that resonates in the target language and culture, sometimes in ways the original never could. As Jakobson observed, translation of art is not a mere reproduction but a “creative transposition”. In the realm of games, it might mean a localized game becomes a beloved version. As Peter Searls eloquently puts it, the translator’s ultimate freedom is “to move beyond mere equivalence, to translate how a text communicates rather than simply what it says”. Exercising this freedom with skill and sensitivity is what transforms translation from a process of loss into an act of literary creation.

## Examples of widely praised transcreation in Disco Elysium
　As an emerging type of translation, video game localisation is beyond simply translating on-screen text. It is a user-centered type of translation that can be framed within functionalist paradigms of translation, whereby the translation process is shaped by the intended purpose or function of the target text (Nord 1997). The main goal of game localisation is to create a functional localised version with a similar look and feel as the original game that produces a similar effect on target players, as if it were a game originally developed for them (O’Hagan & Mangiron 2006). Therefore, the localisation decisions often depend on a new set of user environments with specific linguistic, cultural, and technical implications. (O’Hagan & Mangiron, 2013), which allows game localizers to enjoy a degree of creative freedom far beyond that of other translators. Thus, the term of “transcreation” holds important position in game translation, highlighting that translators are empowered to modify, omit, or add elements to enhance player enjoyment (ibid). The localisation team sometimes even invented lines that didn’t exist in the source texts – effectively a new literary creation – to elicit the intended player reaction. This can be seen as a loss of the original reference, but a gain in audience connection, especially under the context of prioritizing the equivalence of player experience after the transition of game language. 
　There are many exemplary cases of successful transcreation in the Chinese localisation of _Disco Elysium_. For example, the localisation of the names of two non-playable characters (NPCs) in the game—portrayed as young, offbeat hooligans with vulgar speaking style—has been widely appreciated by Chinese players for its humorous and inventive adaptation with a doggerel style. A table chart is provided below to show the source text (ST), the translation, and the back translation (BT) of the Chinese translation with clarity. 
<img width='1203' height='207' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04c003f0-1504-4f25-b8af-7c37da6c884b' />
　It can be said that the typographical choice of employing capitalization in the original English texts not only distinguishes them from ordinary vulgar lines but rather to be character identifiers, it also foreshadows the uniqueness of the ensuing scene—the exchange between the protagonist and the two young hooligans is quite engaging and humorous in the game.
However, the Chinese localisation went even further, not only incorporating elements of the target culture but also enhancing the original text’s literary quality and humor. In fact, it is hard to produce a back translation that fully captures the creative adaptation achieved by the Chinese localisation in its native linguistic and cultural context. Firstly, the Chinese localisation of these two relatively simple English names were substantially expanded, incorporating several new meanings that absent from the original. Each translation begins with a four-character idiom, adding a literary feature to the translation while establishing a parallel structure between the two translations. This stylistic embellishment does not conflict with the characters’ personas; on the contrary, it may reflect a subcultural tendency toward exaggerated, non-mainstream behavior of street thugs, for they may flaunt a kind of pseudo-literary flair. 
　Moreover, the translation mitigates the offensiveness of the original’s blunt vulgarities, which aligns more to the stricter censorship in Chinese market. For example, “fuck” is translated as “干翻,” which is a more moderated rendering in Chinese, while “PISS” is humorously transformed into “取一尿饮 (take a sip of piss)”, further enriching the line with vividity and playfulness. The cumulative effect of these skillful choices significantly enhances the humor and entertainment value of the translation—arguably even surpassing the original, achieving the “emotional localisation” that facilitates target players’ immersion in the game (Díaz Montón, 2010, qtd. in Mangiron, 2016). The localized character names have been widely praised by Chinese players, frequently mentioned in scattered online posts discussing the game’s localisation quality. Such positive receptions reflect the success of this transcreation, which left a deep impression on the players and stands as a testament to the translator’s creativity and cultural sensitivity. 
<br/>
　Except from the above example, there is another example of a successful transcreation in _Disco Elysium_’s Chinese localisation, with the in-game context provided below. The lines in italic in both ST and translation are corresponding that analysis will be conducted.

<img width='1376' height='483' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03319191-00b8-4048-808b-da04854d5d16' />

　In this part of the story, a group of young people aspiring to build an anodic music club within an abandoned church helped a programmer to use their sound equipment for her experiment. The original line of the character EGGHEAD was rich in rhetorical devices, utilizing both alliterations to amplify its sound and rhythm, and parallel structure to reinforce its thematic emphasis. These stylistic elements, however, pose significant challenges for translators to preserve both the rhetorical form and humorous elements of the original.
　The translation of “Pump it to the brick, pump it to the hard master!” was produced largely out of creation, with references to lyrics of one popular Chinese rap song: “野狼Disco (Wild Wolf Disco)” Released in 2019, the song quickly went virus online due to its catchy rhythm, humorous lyrics, and unique musical style. The widespread popularity of this track was also proved by its performances on major stages, including the CCTV Spring Festival Gala. 
　Under the background of the widespread popularity of the song “Wild Wolf Disco” during the same year (2019) of the localisation work, and in consideration of the thematic similarity between the anodic music and Wild Wolf Disco—both being popular and novel among the youth, the localisation team creatively adapted a line from the song’s iconic chorus. The original lyrics—“左手” (on your left) and “右手” (on your right)—form a parallel structure that mirrors the rhetorical techniques of the English source text. The translators also paid attention to preserving the meaning reference in the original source while localizing it in a culturally resonant manner. they added the word “硬核” (hardcore), a concept central to both anodic music in game and EGGHEAD’s character on the lyrical foundation. This localized version has since become one of the most prominent and memorable examples of transcreation in _Disco Elysium_ among Chinese players. It is still frequently mentioned in online discussions by new players today, who express a sense of surprise and cultural intimacy upon encountering a familiar cultural element after reading the game’s otherwise dense and stream-of-consciousness texts. This is a good example echoing to Alvarenga’s (2019) highlights of the significance of linguistic fluency and cultural familiarity in enhancing player immersion through localisation, which plays a critical role in videogames, being responsible for making them positively memorable and offering a unique experience. 
　However, the author would also like to raise the question of whether such a high degree of transcreation leads only to positive influence. In the example discussed above, it becomes apparent that the use of parallel structure in the original ST was intended to convey a clear response to SOONA, THE PROGRAMMER’s question: namely, “yes and turn the volume all the way up!” This core meaning, however, is not explicitly preserved in the transcreated version, failing to the deliver basic mission of translation of “conveying meanings”. Moreover, the translator’s choice to adapt this song lyrics also implicitly assigns a specific characterization to the “anodic music” in the game, which may not be entirely appropriate or consistent with the original. The ambiguous and stream-of-consciousness narrative style in_Disco Elysium_ leaves considerable room for free interpretation of players, which only associated the anodic music to generalized adjective like “love” and “hardcore”. The fixed cultural tone and stylistic qualities of “Wild Wolf Disco” may not fully align with the open and abstract nature of anodic music as originally portrayed.
　In this case, it seems that sometimes the transcreation or adaptation in game localisation may tend to an extreme extent, posing impact on the gameplay experience by breaking the suspension of disbelief of game players. It is important to for the translator to bear in mind “the unavoidable release of meanings that work only in the translating language” (Venuti 2004), and make more cautious and contemplated decisions.

## Conclusion 
　Video game localizers operate on a creative tightrope, where every choice simultaneously incurs a loss and offers a potential gain. On one side lies the ineffable: the untranslatable cultural essences, the rhetorical devices like jokes and puns, the historically bound meanings that inevitably slip away in another language. On the other side lies the inventive spark: the translator’s ability to bring a new life into a text, to craft a work that resonates in the target language and culture, sometimes in ways the original never could. As Jakobson observed, translation of art is not a mere reproduction but a “creative transposition”. In the realm of games, it might mean a localized game becomes a beloved version. As Peter Searls eloquently puts it, the translator’s ultimate freedom is “to move beyond mere equivalence, to translate how a text communicates rather than simply what it says”. Exercising this freedom with skill and sensitivity is what transforms translation from a process of loss into an act of literary creation.

<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>　 <em>Disco Elysium</em> is a groundbreaking role-playing game (RPG) developed by an Estonian studio named ZA/UM. Upon release in 2019, the game has caused a sensation by winning multiple industry-recognized and prestigious awards as a debut work of an unknown independent studio, including Best Narrative and Best Role-Playing Game at <strong>The Game Awards (TGA) 2019[1]</strong>. Set in an imaginative war-torn city of Revachol, players assume the role of an amnesiac detective tasked with solving a murder with limited time and various restrictions.<br>
　On game design, <em>Disco Elysium</em> is widely recognized for its unconventional approach and its exceptional use of language. (Robertson, 2024) Rather than relying on traditional RPG mechanics like combat or leveling through enemies, there are only two core gameplay mechanics: first, manipulating the protagonist to engage in rich and dense dialogues with the game characters and also himself to uncover the truth behind the murder and the whole world-setting; and second, making critical decisions at key plot junctures only via highly randomized results of cyber dice rolls. These designs reflect the game’s strong emphasis on narratology over ludology, with the former seeing games as narratives and representations, the latter focusing on the play action dimensions of games (O’Hagan &amp; Mangiron, 2013).<br>
　Intertextuality, which referred to the text construction as a mosaic of quotations, absorption and transformation from other texts (Kristeva, 1986) is also another important feature of this game. Recently, intertextuality also became an ever-present phenomenon in video games to connect to real history, literature, philosophy, and other media (Duret, 2017). The fundamental framework and the game stage design in <em>Disco Elysium</em> drew extensive references to real-world historical and political events, such as the French Revolution, the communist Soviet Union, and the political upheavals in Eastern Europe. It also incorporates a wide range of political-philosophical ideologies as undertones of the game, including capitalism, communism, liberalism, imperialism, moralism, and fascism etc. Therefore, the magical realist style of game-setting, combined with its rich and sophisticated ideological undertones, further elevates the level of interpretive complexity for players.<br>
　Besides, the game language is also complicated, florid, philosophical, and often poetic—drawing comparisons to literary fiction rather than standard video game writing. Such game language also poses challenges for players. Non-native English speakers, in particular, have noted the difficulty in navigating the game's extensive vocabulary and nuanced dialogues. One player remarked on Reddit, “I had to take my time and re-read entire sentences three, four times sometimes”. Similarly, a discussion on Steam highlighted that even players from English-speaking countries found themselves consulting dictionaries to fully grasp the text.<br>
　Despite the considerable challenges posed by the game's complexity in both the understanding and language of the game, the localisation team of WhisperGames delivered a successful Chinese localisation that received overall positive comments by players across major Chinese gamer online platforms such as GCORES, the NGA forum, and the review section on the Steam platform. <strong>Comments consistently praised the translation for its fluency, clarity, accuracy, and stylistic elegance—clearly distinguishing it from machine translation[2]</strong>.  Players have also expressed appreciation for the localisation team’s outstanding work, which enabled them to access and engage with such a textually dense and conceptually challenging game, but which possesses ideological depth and narrative quality. Completing such a huge localisation project of over one million words within four months is also considered as a remarkable achievement in the field of English-Chinese game localisation. But unfortunately, certain loss in the Chinese localisation of <em>Disco Elysium</em> still prevails due to cultural and linguistic reasons.<br>
　In the following two sections, I will give several representative examples to illustrate the inevitable loss and sophisticated creation in the process of game localisation. Because of technical issues, i.e. unable to conduct text extraction and frequency analysis for the game texts with over one million words, the essay will mainly adopt a qualitative approach.<br>

<h2>Inevitable loss in <em>Disco Elysium</em> Chinese localisation</h2>
<p>　It is commonplace that something is always lost in translation. Early theorists acknowledged that no translation can perfectly replicate all aspects of the original. Eugene Nida (1975) noted that “all types of translation involve (1) loss of information, (2) addition of information, and/or (3) skewing of information”. Catford (1965) defined untranslatability through two aspects: linguistic and cultural, where the failure to find a target language (TL) equivalent lies either in the linguistic differences between the source language (SL) and target language, or in the absence of a functionally relevant feature in the SL. Therefore, wordplays, idioms, local customs and institutions in the ST often cause barriers to the transformation into the target language, which is also the case in game localisation.<br>
　However, the case for <em>Disco Elysium</em> is slightly different. The most prominent loss during the localisation will be the lingual diversity in the original game language. The intonations that manifested in certain language itself, the pragmatic information they convey and the associations they raise are culturally marked, just as Venuti (2004) put it, “Social and regional dialects, ..., and foreign borrowings tend to be language-specific, unlikely to travel well, their peculiar force difficult to render into other languages.” Therefore, in game localisation practices, geographical dialects are generally neutralized in translation (Mangiron 2007), resulting in inevitable loss in translation process.<br>
　<em>Disco Elysium</em> was originally produced and released exclusively in English; however, it features a significant presence of other foreign languages such as French, Spanish, Italian, and Finnish, embedded throughout the game via both voice acting and textual elements. <strong>For native English-speaking players, this multilingualism is easily perceptible[3]</strong>, allowing players to have direct preservations of diverse origins of the game characters. Besides, discussions of the function and representation of the non-English contents have also been stimulated in the game community. These discussions often revolve around how the game took references of the countries in real world speaking these languages—such as the <strong>French Revolution[4]</strong>, which not only enriched the understanding to the game, but also created opportunities for exchanges outside the gameplay that in turn enrich the gaming experience. In contrast, during the localisation process into Chinese, such linguistic diversity was erased. For Chinese players who lack proficiency in English or other foreign languages, it became difficult to detect the game’s multilingual nature therefore to intuitively grasp the nature of the fictional setting of the game as a turbulent melting pot. As a result, they may miss out on the layered cultural complexity that English-speaking players experience more directly.<br>
　Moreover, the non-English languages in the game also caused difficulty or even impossibility to transfer puns generated through the multilinguilism of the game into Chinese. One such example is the translation about a character’s name: “Call Me Mañana” is translated to “叫我马列拉”. In the Chinese translation, the localisation team transliterated the name “Mañana” to “马列拉”, rendering “call me” as “call me by the name of (叫我)”, which is straightforward. However, the Spanish word mañana also means “tomorrow,” allowing players who are familiar with Spanish to interpret it as a potential pun when considered alongside the character’s identity and personality. This character is portrayed as a laid-back, philosophically inclined dockworker who is notably unmotivated to work. If we keep the original meaning of “mañana” in Spanish and interpret “call me” not as a name introduction but as a request for “give me a call,” the entire phrase could be reinterpreted as “Call me tomorrow.” This alternative reading cleverly aligns with the character’s lazy, procrastinatory characteristics, adding a layer of humor and playful implication like “Don’t bother me today. Call me tomorrow”.<br>
　Although the game’s creators have not explicitly confirmed whether this name was intended as a pun, such player-driven interpretation enriches the comedic dimension and enhances the overall engagement of players with the game. Unfortunately, this kind of linguistic playfulness is lost in the Chinese transliteration, although being the most authoritive  and conventional approach in translation of foreign names or appellations in Chinese (Xu 2024), which is a regrettable limitation for failing to convey the cross-linguistic nuance and humor within the game.</p>

<h2>Examples of widely praised transcreation in Disco Elysium</h2>
<p>　As an emerging type of translation, video game localisation is beyond simply translating on-screen text. It is a user-centered type of translation that can be framed within functionalist paradigms of translation, whereby the translation process is shaped by the intended purpose or function of the target text (Nord 1997). The main goal of game localisation is to create a functional localised version with a similar look and feel as the original game that produces a similar effect on target players, as if it were a game originally developed for them (O’Hagan &amp; Mangiron 2006). Therefore, the localisation decisions often depend on a new set of user environments with specific linguistic, cultural, and technical implications. (O’Hagan &amp; Mangiron, 2013), which allows game localizers to enjoy a degree of creative freedom far beyond that of other translators. Thus, the term of “transcreation” holds important position in game translation, highlighting that translators are empowered to modify, omit, or add elements to enhance player enjoyment (ibid). The localisation team sometimes even invented lines that didn’t exist in the source texts – effectively a new literary creation – to elicit the intended player reaction. This can be seen as a loss of the original reference, but a gain in audience connection, especially under the context of prioritizing the equivalence of player experience after the transition of game language.<br>
　There are many exemplary cases of successful transcreation in the Chinese localisation of <em>Disco Elysium</em>. For example, the localisation of the names of two non-playable characters (NPCs) in the game—portrayed as young, offbeat hooligans with vulgar speaking style—has been widely appreciated by Chinese players for its humorous and inventive adaptation with a doggerel style. A table chart is provided below to show the source text (ST), the translation, and the back translation (BT) of the Chinese translation with clarity.<br>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04c003f0-1504-4f25-b8af-7c37da6c884b"><img width="1203" height="207" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04c003f0-1504-4f25-b8af-7c37da6c884b" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 207px;"></a><br>
　It can be said that the typographical choice of employing capitalization in the original English texts not only distinguishes them from ordinary vulgar lines but rather to be character identifiers, it also foreshadows the uniqueness of the ensuing scene—the exchange between the protagonist and the two young hooligans is quite engaging and humorous in the game.<br>
However, the Chinese localisation went even further, not only incorporating elements of the target culture but also enhancing the original text’s literary quality and humor. In fact, it is hard to produce a back translation that fully captures the creative adaptation achieved by the Chinese localisation in its native linguistic and cultural context. Firstly, the Chinese localisation of these two relatively simple English names were substantially expanded, incorporating several new meanings that absent from the original. Each translation begins with a four-character idiom, adding a literary feature to the translation while establishing a parallel structure between the two translations. This stylistic embellishment does not conflict with the characters’ personas; on the contrary, it may reflect a subcultural tendency toward exaggerated, non-mainstream behavior of street thugs, for they may flaunt a kind of pseudo-literary flair.<br>
　Moreover, the translation mitigates the offensiveness of the original’s blunt vulgarities, which aligns more to the stricter censorship in Chinese market. For example, “fuck” is translated as “干翻,” which is a more moderated rendering in Chinese, while “PISS” is humorously transformed into “取一尿饮 (take a sip of piss)”, further enriching the line with vividity and playfulness. The cumulative effect of these skillful choices significantly enhances the humor and entertainment value of the translation—arguably even surpassing the original, achieving the “emotional localisation” that facilitates target players’ immersion in the game (Díaz Montón, 2010, qtd. in Mangiron, 2016). The localized character names have been widely praised by Chinese players, frequently mentioned in scattered online posts discussing the game’s localisation quality. Such positive receptions reflect the success of this transcreation, which left a deep impression on the players and stands as a testament to the translator’s creativity and cultural sensitivity.<br>
<br><br>
　Except from the above example, there is another example of a successful transcreation in <em>Disco Elysium</em>’s Chinese localisation, with the in-game context provided below. The lines in italic in both ST and translation are corresponding that analysis will be conducted.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03319191-00b8-4048-808b-da04854d5d16"><img width="1376" height="483" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03319191-00b8-4048-808b-da04854d5d16" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 483px;"></a></p>
<p>　In this part of the story, a group of young people aspiring to build an anodic music club within an abandoned church helped a programmer to use their sound equipment for her experiment. The original line of the character EGGHEAD was rich in rhetorical devices, utilizing both alliterations to amplify its sound and rhythm, and parallel structure to reinforce its thematic emphasis. These stylistic elements, however, pose significant challenges for translators to preserve both the rhetorical form and humorous elements of the original.<br>
　The translation of “Pump it to the brick, pump it to the hard master!” was produced largely out of creation, with references to lyrics of one popular Chinese rap song: “野狼Disco (Wild Wolf Disco)” Released in 2019, the song quickly went virus online due to its catchy rhythm, humorous lyrics, and unique musical style. The widespread popularity of this track was also proved by its performances on major stages, including the CCTV Spring Festival Gala.<br>
　Under the background of the widespread popularity of the song “Wild Wolf Disco” during the same year (2019) of the localisation work, and in consideration of the thematic similarity between the anodic music and Wild Wolf Disco—both being popular and novel among the youth, the localisation team creatively adapted a line from the song’s iconic chorus. The original lyrics—“左手” (on your left) and “右手” (on your right)—form a parallel structure that mirrors the rhetorical techniques of the English source text. The translators also paid attention to preserving the meaning reference in the original source while localizing it in a culturally resonant manner. they added the word “硬核” (hardcore), a concept central to both anodic music in game and EGGHEAD’s character on the lyrical foundation. This localized version has since become one of the most prominent and memorable examples of transcreation in <em>Disco Elysium</em> among Chinese players. It is still frequently mentioned in online discussions by new players today, who express a sense of surprise and cultural intimacy upon encountering a familiar cultural element after reading the game’s otherwise dense and stream-of-consciousness texts. This is a good example echoing to Alvarenga’s (2019) highlights of the significance of linguistic fluency and cultural familiarity in enhancing player immersion through localisation, which plays a critical role in videogames, being responsible for making them positively memorable and offering a unique experience.<br>
　However, the author would also like to raise the question of whether such a high degree of transcreation leads only to positive influence. In the example discussed above, it becomes apparent that the use of parallel structure in the original ST was intended to convey a clear response to SOONA, THE PROGRAMMER’s question: namely, “yes and turn the volume all the way up!” This core meaning, however, is not explicitly preserved in the transcreated version, failing to the deliver basic mission of translation of “conveying meanings”. Moreover, the translator’s choice to adapt this song lyrics also implicitly assigns a specific characterization to the “anodic music” in the game, which may not be entirely appropriate or consistent with the original. The ambiguous and stream-of-consciousness narrative style in_Disco Elysium_ leaves considerable room for free interpretation of players, which only associated the anodic music to generalized adjective like “love” and “hardcore”. The fixed cultural tone and stylistic qualities of “Wild Wolf Disco” may not fully align with the open and abstract nature of anodic music as originally portrayed.<br>
　In this case, it seems that sometimes the transcreation or adaptation in game localisation may tend to an extreme extent, posing impact on the gameplay experience by breaking the suspension of disbelief of game players. It is important to for the translator to bear in mind “the unavoidable release of meanings that work only in the translating language” (Venuti 2004), and make more cautious and contemplated decisions.<br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>　Video game localizers operate on a creative tightrope, where every choice simultaneously incurs a loss and offers a potential gain. On one side lies the ineffable: the untranslatable cultural essences, the rhetorical devices like jokes and puns, the historically bound meanings that inevitably slip away in another language. On the other side lies the inventive spark: the translator’s ability to bring a new life into a text, to craft a work that resonates in the target language and culture, sometimes in ways the original never could. As Jakobson observed, translation of art is not a mere reproduction but a “creative transposition”. In the realm of games, it might mean a localized game becomes a beloved version. As Peter Searls eloquently puts it, the translator’s ultimate freedom is “to move beyond mere equivalence, to translate how a text communicates rather than simply what it says”. Exercising this freedom with skill and sensitivity is what transforms translation from a process of loss into an act of literary creation.<br>
