## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Project background
The flourishing international market has seen the rapid development of online games. As a new and powerful literary form, game culture has garnered increasing academic and public attention. Consequently, high-quality localisation and translation have become increasingly significant in order to meet the demands of a diverse global audience. In this context, the practice of localising interactive media has garnered significant attention due to its unique complexity. Game localisation is not confined to linguistic conversion. It must also handle the intertwining of multiple modes, including visual design, audio, and user interaction. Broadly speaking, game localisation refers to the process of adapting a game for players in a target country, including content and functional adjustments made to comply with local laws and market environments (Swalwell, 2021:1-15). More narrowly, it primarily focuses on the translation of in-game text, characters, plot, and scenes. The fundamental goal is to overcome a product’s inherent linguistic and cultural barriers, making the game more suitable for local players’ habits, language environment, and cognitive levels, thereby expanding the player base and increasing revenue. Consequently, game localisation is a complex, interdisciplinary process that not only involves language translation but also requires consideration of multiple dimensions, such as cultural norms, legal regulations, and technical backgrounds.
In recent years, game streaming has emerged as a rapidly growing segment of the interactive entertainment industry, attracting an expansive and diverse audience. The overall live streaming market in China has seen rapid expansion, driven by the increasing popularity of platforms like Douyin (TikTok) and Bilibili, which have surpassed more traditional, dedicated game-streaming sites in popularity. In 2024, the number of game live-stream viewers in China reached 266 million (Vyas, 2025:1). Therefore, many game developers and publishers collaborate with popular streamers, recording their gameplay sessions, editing the content into highlight reels, and distributing these videos across online streaming platforms in order to showcase the game’s appeal and broaden its player base, which has become a key marketing strategy for game developers. Consequently, the demand for live-stream subtitles has increased significantly.
However, the shift in audience to prospective consumers instead of players, along with the change in medium to promotional content instead of immersive gameplay, alters the fundamental purpose when translating live-stream subtitles compared to in-game text localisation. What’s more, the unique technical constraints inherent to the subtitle format itself further necessitate distinct translation strategies since subtitling is governed by strict spatiotemporal limitations: the text must synchronize precisely with audio and visual cues, remain on screen for a limited duration, and conform to character limits per line, which often leads to different translation strategies.

### 1.2 Significance of the project
This study is particularly significant as it addresses a notable gap in Chinese academic research on the localisation of real-time streaming games. While the field of game localisation has gained attention, this specific area of comparative study between localisation and subtitles remains largely unexplored. Therefore, the present project aims to: (1) compare both shared and different translation strategies for in-game text and live-stream subtitles; (2) explain divergences in readership and strategy through Skopos theory and multimodal translation theory; and (3) offer a theoretical framework and practical recommendations for translators and localisers working in multimodal contexts.

### 1.3 Structure of the report
This dissertation is structured into five chapters, mainly comparing translation strategies for in-game text and live-stream subtitles.
Chapter 1 introduces the research background, aims, and methodology. Chapter 2 reviews relevant translation theories, specifically Skopos Theory, and provides an analysis of the source text types. Chapter 3 delves into the Skopos Theory framework, analysing the distinct target audiences and communicative purposes for in-game text and live-stream subtitles. Chapter 4 presents a comparative analysis through specific case studies, highlighting shared and differing translation strategies such as explicitation, simplification, and dynamic variations. Chapter 5 summarises the key findings, emphasising the guiding role of Skopos Theory in game localisation and offering insights into the industry, such as the need for context-aware translation tools and the proactive role of the translator in the process. 

## Chapter 2: Preparation of Translation
The translator’s preparation for translation commonly decides the quality of translation. An optimal translation program contains “background preparation” and “actual processes”, and there are four fundamental stages in the process of translation: analysing the source text, translating source text into target text, reorganizing the target language and testing the translated text (Nida, 2001:21).
Regarding background preparation, the author engaged in a series of preparatory steps to ensure both linguistic accuracy and functional adequacy. These included background research into the historical and cultural context of the game, a comprehensive reading of the full English script to gain familiarity with its narrative flow and stylistic features, and the adoption of the developer-provided CAT tool to manage the technical aspects of localisation. Together, these measures established a solid foundation for the translation process, combining cultural knowledge, textual analysis, and technical competence.

### 2.1 About the game
_The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ is an adventure game developed by the British game studio, Afoot Games, and was released on the Steam platform on 26 March 2025. This game is adapted from Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective novel series, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Set in a cosy Sussex village called Fulworth during the early 20th century, the game depicts Sherlock Holmes in his retirement as a beekeeper, attempting to organise a clifftop picnic for Dr. John H Watson. In the process of preparing for the event, he encounters a series of unexpected local mysteries, which he must resolve using his intellect and with the assistance of his friends in the village. The whole story is made up of three main mysteries, which involves the case of a missing cat, the disappearance of a village fete judge, and a con artist who claims to have found a mermaid fossil on the beach. As players explore the game, they can talk to specific characters or investigate details in the scenes to unlock new dialogues and backstories. 
_The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ features its emphasis on exploration, dialogue, and player choice. The game has twelve fully voice-acted characters, which includes both familiar faces from the original stories and brand-new original characters. Players can interact with iconic figures like Sherlock Holmes’s loyal partner, John Watson, as well as a new cast of characters such as a clown with a tragic past, a budding young naturalist, a devoted fan of Holmes, a cunning fraudster and so on. Through a point-and-click interface, players can gather clues through examination, interact with various objects and characters, and solve puzzles that frequently offer multiple solutions by combining the findings. Also, players can move through the plot at their own pace, and as they solve these mysteries, they can also collect the items needed for the picnic in order to complete the final task and unlock the ending. In conclusion, the game’s reliance on extensive conversation and its deeply embedded cultural context makes it an ideal subject for a comparative analysis of translation strategies. 

### 2.2 Localisation software
In terms of actual translation practice, the translator relied on the developer-provided computer-assisted translation tool AGS Translation Editor (see Figure 1). This specialised software is designed to parse files generated by the Adventure Game Studio (AGS) engine, automatically extracting the in-game text into .tra files. These texts are then displayed in sequence in the main interface according to the original coding order. By referencing the source text in the left-hand column and inputting the target text in the right-hand column, the translator can export the translated content as a .trs file. This file type can be directly re-imported into the game, thereby integrating the translation smoothly into the software environment and significantly facilitating the localisation process.

### 2.3 Analysis of the Source Text
Given the multimodal and interactive nature of video games, the textual material they contain is highly heterogeneous. A clear categorisation of text types is therefore necessary to reveal how different functional roles and semiotic constraints shape translation strategies. 

#### 2.3.1 UI-related segments
Segments related to user interface (UI) constitute one of the most technical and function-oriented categories of in-game text. In _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_, dynamic prompts are the most representative example of this category. Within the game, players can perform four actions: “Pick Up”, “Examine”, “Use”, and “Converse”. Before the player confirms an action, a line of white text appears at the bottom of the screen, showing the action and the object of interaction (see Figure 2). In the code for this dynamic prompt, the object of interaction is set as a variable, which will change according to the player’s selection. Therefore, UI-related segments carry specific technical constraints because the variables are directly integrated into the game’s code. Translators must first ensure that the variable references and formatting remain intact so that the game engine can correctly display the dynamic prompts.

#### 2.3.2 Dialogues in the non-interactive cutscene
Cutscenes are non-interactive animations in which the player becomes only a viewer rather than an active participant. In _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_, cutscenes are heavily dialogue-driven and function as key narrative vehicles. They closely resemble audiovisual translation contexts such as film or television drama, in that speech, tone, and timing must be synchronised with visual and auditory cues. The translation of cutscene dialogue must therefore balance narrative fidelity with subtitling constraints, including spatial limits and temporal synchronisation. In this sense, the localisation of cutscenes in games is similar to audiovisual translation.

#### 2.3.3 Interaction with NPCs
Conversational exchanges with non-playable characters (NPCs) are central to the game’s progression. Unlike cutscenes, these dialogues are triggered by player actions. They are interactive in nature, providing players with immediate feedback. Translating NPC dialogues requires particular attention to consistency in characterisation, register, and tone, since these conversations not only deliver plot information but also contribute to world-building and player immersion. The interactive quality of NPC dialogues also implies that their localisation must anticipate multiple potential pathways, maintaining coherence across divergent branches.

#### 2.3.4 Interaction with objects
Another significant category consists of object-related interactions, whereby players inspect, manipulate, or combine items within the game space. These texts are typically short, descriptive, and functional, but they often carry narrative weight by revealing clues, unlocking further interactions, or contributing to puzzle-solving mechanics. From a translational perspective, the challenge lies in maintaining both clarity and conciseness. The target text must provide sufficient guidance without overtly undermining the immersive experience of the game itself. Furthermore, object interactions frequently involve multimodal interplay between text, visual design, and player agency, requiring translations that align seamlessly with the game’s mechanics and semiotic resources.

#### 2.3.5 Dialogues with specific cultural or historical background
The game also includes dialogues imbued with distinct cultural and historical references, particularly those related to late Victorian and Edwardian England. Such dialogues draw upon intertextual allusions, social registers, and historically embedded practices that may be unfamiliar to target audiences. For example, references to Sherlockian lore, British institutions, or early 20th century material culture pose challenges of cultural transference. This category highlights the tension between cultural authenticity and accessibility, positioning translation as a negotiation between historical fidelity and target readership comprehension.

#### 2.3.6 Special texts which are not included in the in-game text
Finally, the game includes a special category of text not embedded within the gameplay narrative or UI, such as the interlude lyrics. While not functional in a direct sense, their inclusion is a deliberate choice, intended to serve a specific expressive purpose. These songs are intentionally chosen because their lyrics are tightly interwoven with the plot, subtly reinforcing the narrative’s themes, foreshadowing upcoming events, or providing insight into a character’s emotional state. Their primary function is to deepen the player’s emotional engagement and enrich their understanding of the story beyond the main dialogue. In the process of translating song lyrics, particular attention must also be paid to preserving the original rhythm and aesthetic qualities as far as possible. 

### 2.4 Characteristics of In-Game Text and Live-Stream Subtitles
In-game text mainly appears in dialogue boxes (see Figure 3). These allow relative flexibility in restructuring language: translators can freely adjust word order, split or merge sentences, and occasionally add interpretive details as long as spatial constraints are respected. The pace of interaction is player-controlled, enabling more flexibility in stylistic and linguistic adaptation.
Live-stream subtitles are time-bound and must synchronize with the spoken audio and visual rhythm of the stream. The subtitle format imposes strict temporal and spatial constraints, requiring brevity, legibility, and alignment with oral delivery (see Figure 3). However, subtitles also offer access to the spoken context and intonation, enabling the translator to clarify or expand upon cultural elements through informative paraphrasing without disrupting user experience.

### 2.5 Project workflow
The workflow for this project was divided into two main tasks. The first stage involved the translation of the in-game text using the AGS Translation Editor. A total of 52,584 words were processed, including dialogues, UI-related segments, and texts within the game scenes or images. 
The second stage focused on the production of Chinese subtitles for a three-hour live stream video provided by the developer which showcases a portion of the plot and gameplay. Since the video content was identical to the in-game material, the subtitles were largely based on the previous translations of in-game texts which was produced in the first stage. However, in order to meet the requirements of subtitling conventions and the specific guidelines set for Chinese subtitles, necessary modifications were made to the final target texts. These included adjustments for timing, line breaks, and readability, as well as occasional annotations to aid comprehension for specific audience.


## Chapter 3: Theoretical Framework
### 3.1 Key concepts of the Skopos theory
Skopos theory developed in Germany in the 1970s and was first put forward by scholar Vermeer. “Skopos” comes from Greek, meaning “purpose”, and the term usually refers to the “communication purpose” of the target language text. As stated by Vermeer, the purpose of translation determines every action of` translation, which indicates that the purpose determines the method. 
Vermeer exercises the concept of “purpose” into translation process, pointing out that translation is a purposeful intercultural communication (activity), highlighting the decisive role of “purpose” for the entire translation practice, and advocating that the translation method is determined by the purpose of translation.
Skopos theory highlights that the translator should centre on the aimed purpose of the translation and choose translation methods in accordance with this purpose. However, the purpose of the translation determines the method or strategy. During translation, the translator must follow three main principles: Skopos rule, coherence rule and fidelity rule.
Skopos rule features core rule of Skopos theory, including the purpose of the translator, the communicative purpose of the translation, and the purpose to be completed by using certain methods. The fact that “'method is determined by result' means that the purpose determines the entire translation practice. Guided by the Skopos rule, the translator chooses corresponding translation strategies and methods to adaptably cope with the difference between the source text and the target text, which helps the target language players have a better comprehension (Chen, 2016: 89-90). In a general sense, “purpose” indicates the communicative function of the translation on the target readers in the socio-cultural context of the target language (Venuti, 2001:13). Consequently, translators initially need to comprehend the translation context and the purpose of the text before translating, and then adopt equivalent translation method based on the translation purpose.
Coherence rule means that the translation must be intra-textual coherence, and the translation must be comprehensible and appropriate. The target language readers can understand the translation, and the translation has actual meaning in both social and cultural context of the target language. The translation will not be misunderstood by target readers due to the lack of information and obstacles. A communicative interaction can only be regarded as a success if the receivers interpret it as being sufficiently coherent with their situation (Nord, 2001:32).
Fidelity rule puts forward that there must be inter-textual coherence between the source text and the target text (Munday, 2010:128). The target text must be faithful to the source text. The purpose of the translation and the translator's understanding of the source text reveal the translation’s faithfulness to the target text (R. Xu &amp; H. Xu, 2018: 103-105). 
Among the three rules of Skopos theory, Skopos rule is the uppermost one. Fidelity rule is subsidiary to the coherence rule. At the same time, both coherence rule and fidelity rule are premised on the Skopos rule.

### 3.2 Practice under the guidance of Skopos theory
In the case of in-game text, the Skopos is to sustain immersion and ensure functional adequacy for the player. The player, conceptualised as a player-as-reader, is an active participant who advances the narrative and directly triggers the appearance of text segments through their actions. For this audience, the translation must remain unobtrusive and natural, reinforcing the illusion of direct engagement with the fictional world. Over-explanation or redundant information would undermine coherence and disrupt the immersive effect. The coherence rule here demands that the translated text integrates seamlessly into the gameplay context, while fidelity to the source is only relevant insofar as it supports this overriding purpose.
By contrast, live-stream subtitles serve a markedly different communicative purpose. Their audience extends beyond active players to include spectators and potential consumers, many of whom may have little or no prior knowledge of the game’s mechanics. The Skopos in this context is accessibility and immediate comprehensibility. Subtitles must therefore be intelligible without reliance on player interaction or contextual cues, and may legitimately employ explicitation or minor adaptation to achieve communicative efficiency. Here, the coherence rule requires that the translation aligns with the expectations and viewing conditions of a heterogeneous audience, while the fidelity rule is subordinated to the goal of maximising comprehension and sustaining attention.

### 3.3 Analysis of the target readers
From the perspective of Skopos Theory, the decisive factor shaping translational action is the orientation towards the target reader (Vermeer, 2000:18). Although the in-game text and live-stream subtitles of _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ derive from the same source material, they are designed for markedly different readerships, which results in distinct functional objectives and, consequently, divergent translational strategies.
The in-game text is primarily directed towards an audience of Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts and established fans of detective fiction, since they need to buy the game before enjoying the content. This readership is assumed to possess a certain degree of cultural literacy regarding late Victorian and Edwardian settings, as well as intertextual references to the Sherlockian canon. For such an audience, translations must ensure their sense of immersion without drawing attention by excessive interference. In this context, the coherence rule requires smooth, unobtrusive texts that integrate seamlessly with gameplay, while fidelity to the source is valued insofar as it reinforces narrative consistency and character authenticity. Excessive explanation or intrusive annotation would disrupt the immersive experience and risk alienating the fan community.
By contrast, the live-stream subtitles target a more heterogeneous and often non-specialist audience. Many viewers are casual spectators with little prior knowledge of Holmesian lore or the cultural specificities of nineteenth-century Britain. The Skopos here shifts from immersion to accessibility and promotion. Subtitles are expected not only to render the narrative intelligible but also to stimulate interest in the game as a cultural product. To achieve this, the translator may resort to explicitation, additional annotation, or the amplification of metaphorical expressions that might otherwise remain opaque to non-fans. In this way, subtitles function as a mediating tool that lowers the barrier to entry and, in line with their promotional function, encourages wider audience engagement.
In sum, although both modalities share the general purpose of making the narrative accessible, their differing target readers necessitate divergent strategies. The in-game text privileges immersion for a knowledgeable fanbase, whereas live-stream subtitles prioritise clarity and appeal for broader audiences. Skopos theory provides a principled framework for explaining this divergence by situating translation decisions within the communicative needs of their respective readerships.

## Chapter 4: Case Study (English-Chinese part)
Building on the typological and theoretical groundwork established in the previous chapter, this section turns to a detailed case study of selected source texts from _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_. The analysis focuses on how the same textual material is localised under both in-game text and live-stream subtitles, and how their respective Skopos and text types guide the practice of translation. 
The discussion is organised into two parts. The first examines shared strategies, i.e. those approaches that operate across both modalities regardless of medium, reflecting common functional requirements such as maintaining narrative coherence or ensuring linguistic naturalness. The second investigates differentiated strategies, where divergences arise due to variations in communicative purpose and target readership. 

### 4.1 Shared strategies of translating in-game texts and live-stream subtitles
#### 4.1.1 Explicitation of logical connectives
The Chinese language is characterised as a language of parataxis. Chinese tends to use a series of relatively short, independent clauses placed in sequence to form a sentence or a text. This feature renders the connections within Chinese texts more organic and flexible, which means that Chinese readers rely more heavily on context to understand the logical relationships between sentences (Li, 2025:9). Consequently, adding logical connectives that are implicit in the source text can enhance the coherence of the target text during translation. This approach not only aligns more closely with Chinese expressive and reading conventions but also ensures greater fluency and naturalness in the translated text. Through the translation strategy of explicitation of connectives, the cognitive load for both game players and live-stream viewers can be reduced. 
The following paragraphs provide a detailed analysis of an example in my practice. 

&lt;img width='1353' height='486' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02b1ea16-be89-407c-87c9-bb0e0df8e7f0' /&gt;

In example 1 (see Table 1), an NPC named Ruffles were talking about his tragic experiences with Holmes in the World War I. In the source text, the first sentence states the fact that Ruffles’s eye was injured, while the second sentence describes the treatment he received at the hospital and the positive outcome. The shift in emotion is only implicitly conveyed by the context in the source text. Therefore, by adding “幸运的是” (fortunately) in the target text, this turning point and emotional shift are made explicit to the audience. This allows both the players and viewers to immediately feel the change from misfortune to good luck without having to infer the logical connection, which not only aligns with the language habits of the target audience but also improves the text’s fluency and narrative pace, in line with the functional approach emphasised by Skopos Theory. 
More importantly, the addition of this logical connective also resonates with the visual elements in the game and the live-stream. As shown in Figure 4, when delivering the first line, Ruffles closes his eyes with a deeply sorrowful expression, reflecting his inner pain. However, his expression turns to one of relief in the second sentence. By explicating the logical relation between the two sentences, the translation allows the dialogue to interact harmoniously with the visual cues on the screen, thereby enhancing the sense of immersion for both players and viewers.

_Figure 4: Screenshot of example 1_

In addition, the translation of the first sentence is also adapted in light of the visual cues. From Ruffles’s portrait in Figure 4, it is evident that he wears an eyepatch over his left eye, confirming that “one eye gone” in the original refers specifically to his left eye. A literal rendering such as “一只眼睛失明，另一只眼睛角膜受损” (one eye is blind, and the other eye’s cornea is damaged) would sound redundant in Chinese. Instead, drawing on the visual information to translate them directly as “左眼彻底失明” (my left eye is completely blind) and “右眼角膜受损” (my right eye’s cornea is damaged) enables the audience to process the plot more quickly and smoothly. 

#### 4.1.2 Explicitation of semantic information
Similarly, explicating semantic information explicit in the original text can also clarify meanings that would otherwise rely on context or inference, thereby serving the shared purpose of enhancing immersion. 

&lt;img width='1368' height='647' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfd5b840-295c-4103-8d93-e3e0e5b2aa48' /&gt;

Example 2 (see Table 2) presents a dialogue in which Holmes notices Watson reading a mystery novel. As Watson is also writing biographies of Holmes’s cases which can also be classified as mystery novel, Holmes assumes that Watson’s purpose in reading this book is to “familiarise with his competition.” However, a literal translation of this phrase into Chinese such as “熟悉你的比赛” would not only sound unnatural but would also create obstacles to readers’ comprehension. Therefore, in the translation of Holmes’s question, his semantic information is made explicit by adding the clue of “作家同行” (fellow writer) in order to convey the underlying intent of Holmes’s question more clearly.
Then in Watson’s reply, the translation renders “little story” as “推理小说” (mystery novel) further explicating the central topic of the dialogue and clarifying the implication of Holmes’s question, thereby facilitating the reader’s comprehension of the plot development. Moreover, since the previous sentence is a question, the Chinese translation chooses to add a direct response “没有” (no), which strengthens the coherence between the dialogues and ensures greater logical fluency.
In conclusion, this translation ensures that the dialogue remains coherent and readily accessible to the target audience. Adapting the wording to make implicit relations explicit and to enhance logical flow serves the communicative function of the translation, prioritising audience understanding and narrative continuity over literal fidelity to the source text.

#### 4.1.3 Contextual adaptation

&lt;img width='1307' height='795' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3afa01d-56a7-4a72-b0be-e82e4a5a22dd' /&gt;

Example 3 (see Table 3) presents a quarrel between Holmes and a fraudster. In the previous plot, Holmes, by examining Pippi’s so-called “mermaid”, discovered evidence of forgery and deduced that it had been fabricated by stitching together the specimens of a monkey and a fish. Holmes hoped to restore peace to the beach occupied by crowds drawn by Pippi and her mermaid, but her refusal to listen or to leave gradually provoked his anger during their conversation. The emotional shift between the two characters is conveyed through the game’s voice acting, so the dialogue itself should correspond to this change of feeling to enhance immersion. In the source text, their dialogues are almost identical, relying only on slight changes in sentence length and punctuation to suggest a progression of tone. A literal reproduction of this repetition in Chinese would appear rigid and unnatural, lacking the sense of authentic dialogue.
Therefore, in my translation, each line is adapted according to the narrative context. For example, Pippi’s the response “没有就是没有” (I told you didn’t) reinforces her persistence and growing impatience; and her third, “才没有呢!” (I certainly didn’t!) is more colloquial and emotionally charged, showing her outburst. This gradual variation aligns with Chinese colloquial expressions. At the same time, for Holmes’s line is also adapted entirely. The original “Indeed you did” is translated as “证据确凿” (The evidence is conclusive), which can resonate with the preceding scene in which Holmes investigates Pippi’s “mermaid and uncovers evidence of forgery, reinforcing his identity as a detective. And “You did!” was translated as “你撒谎!” to avoid repetition and enhance dramatic tension. 
From the perspective of Skopos Theory, this approach fulfils the communicative purpose of the translation by enhancing linguistic naturalness, highlighting characterisation, and supporting narrative development. 

### 4.2 Different strategies of translating in-game texts and live-stream subtitles
#### 4.2.1 Simplification in subtitles
When comparing in-game text with live-stream subtitles, one of the most obvious differences lies in the restrictions imposed on subtitles by time and space. Subtitles must appear on screen in synchrony with spoken audio, remain visible long enough to be read comfortably, and occupy limited screen space without obscuring key visual elements. Therefore, subtitles must prioritise brevity, legibility, and rhythmical alignment with oral delivery. This means that subtitles need to selectively omit content unrelated to the plot itself to maintain the greatest possible conciseness, which ensures smooth processing and uninterrupted immersion for video viewers.

&lt;img width='1302' height='927' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b491a34d-f6f1-4a52-9af2-ffb324b687e3' /&gt;

Example 4 is a prompt triggered when the player interacts with the telephone during the investigation stage. In _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_, in order to prevent players from feeling uncertain about how to advance the storyline and to enhance the smoothness of gameplay, the developer introduced a special function that allows Holmes to contact his brother Mycroft through the telephone in the scene and seek his advice. Mycroft’s suggestions change dynamically according to the player’s progress in the game.
Within the game itself, such prompt plays a crucial functional role because it can indicate possible actions for players to avoid causing confusion. According to Skopos Theory, the communicative purpose of in-game translation is therefore not only to preserve narrative fidelity but also to maintain the usability and playability of the product. For this reason, prompts and operational instructions must be retained to fulfil their purpose.
By contrast, in the context of live-stream subtitles, the audience assumes a very different role. Viewers are not participants in gameplay, and thus do not require operational guidance. The Skopos of the subtitle text is to provide an accessible narrative experience, highlighting plot development rather than procedural accuracy. Accordingly, the translator can omit such prompts if necessary. This reduction serves two functions. First, it can avoid distracting the audience with information irrelevant to their experience. Second, it will lower the reading burden by reducing the volume of subtitle text, thereby preserving immersion in the unfolding story.
In the in-game text of example 4, in order to emphasize the location and function of this telephone, the source text in game specifically highlights “use the telephone” and “when I’m at loss.” In the localisation practice, both elements are retained in order to fulfil their functional purpose. However, in the case of subtitles, such information is unnecessary for the viewers. So these parts are intentionally omitted so as to preserve the brevity of the subtitles.

#### 4.2.2 Dynamic variation
In some cases, the dialogues triggered by different in-game interactions are the same. As a result, the in-game translation can only provide a general translation since in programming, one dialogue code can only correspond to one string of text. By contrast, subtitles for live-streams are not bound by this technical limitation. The translator can therefore adapt the same source text in different ways according to the surrounding context and narrative situation, producing variation that feels more natural and expressive.

Example 5 (see Table 5) appears in the investigation stage at Baker Street. When the player attempts to “converse” with irrelevant items, such as slippers, paintings, or the carpet, Watson would ask whether he is “slightly bored.” Therefore, the same dialogue can be repeatedly triggered in a short span of time within the same scene, and the same dialogue was likewise repeated within less than five minutes in the live-stream. Although the in-game text cannot be altered, the subtitles allow for greater flexibility. To avoid repetition, when the line appeared a second time, I chose to rendered Watson’s question into “are you sure you’re all right”, which both prevented redundancy and subtly suggested a progression in Watson’s emotional state, conveying greater concern the second time he posed the question to Holmes.

&lt;img width='1320' height='513' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cc0a7b6-9a28-4f4c-8b76-589e27a22833' /&gt;

Similarly, in Example 6 (see Table 6), the live-stream subtitles were adapted in order to create variation between the two identical dialogues and to allow them to integrate more smoothly into the narrative. In the live-stream, the first time Holmes calls the dog Toby it is to take him to the crime scene, while the second time it is to send him home. Accordingly, I adapted the translation in line with the corresponding context.
In conclusion, the Skopos of subtitles is enhancing narrative flow and immersion for viewers, so dynamic variation has the ability to reflect the psychological activities of a character under different contextual situation. Through reducing redundancy, aligning the language more closely with natural conversational patterns, the subtitles can ultimately offer the audience a smoother and more engaging viewing experience.

#### 4.2.3 Adding annotations in subtitles
_The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ is a game adapted from the Sherlock Holmes series, and therefore some dialogues involve direct references or creative adaptations of the canon. As discussed in Chapter 3, the target readers of the game are mainly those who already possess familiarity with the relevant cultural background. however, the live-stream is intended as a form of promotion, meaning that a significant proportion of its target readers may lack relevant knowledge. Without appropriate explanation, viewers of the live-stream videos may feel confused by the plot and be unable to appreciate the humour in the source text, thereby undermining the purpose of attracting a wider audience. 
Since only subtitles can have annotations added, the example below shows only the translation of live-stream subtitles and the corresponding annotation.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0154917d-8ea9-4e10-8ddc-36673d3e5c74)

In Example 7 (See Table 7), Holmes is talking to an NPC named “Ruffles.” Because the pronunciation of “Raffles” and “Ruffles” is similar, Holmes mistakenly assumes that this NPC is a relative of Raffles the cricketer. To understand the humour underlying this exchange, it is necessary to be aware of a specific cultural background that Raffles was a criminal character created by Conan Doyle’s brother-in-law, who took inspiration from Holmes himself. Since Holmes is a detective who pursues criminals, he ironically remarks that they are “in the same circle.” To assist the audience of live-stream in grasping this allusion, a brief but essential annotation is added to the top right of the screen (see Figure 5), which not only supports comprehension of the scene but also enables interested viewers to seek out further information and expand their knowledge.

&lt;img width='398' height='223' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0af91934-bf8c-42b5-a644-4812d9567421' /&gt;

_Figure 5: Screenshot of example 7_

Annotations can contribute to the Skopos of the live-stream by attracting and engaging a wider audience by making the content accessible. However, the coherence rule of Skopos Theory also requires that the translation be easily processable for the target audience. If annotations are overly long or with relevant information, they risk imposing a cognitive burden on viewers, distracting them from the dialogues and plots. For this reason, annotations must remain concise, offering only the essential cultural or contextual information. 

#### 4.2.4 Synchronisation of subtitles
Subtitles are required to remain closely synchronised with the accompanying audio, as they must appear and disappear in tandem with the spoken dialogue. This temporal constraint means that long or complex sentences in the source text cannot always be transferred directly into the target text without risking a mismatch between reading time and speech rhythm. To address this, translators often reformulate or restructure longer sentences in line with the pauses and intonation patterns of the voice acting. Such adaptation not only maintains synchrony but also ensures that the subtitles can be read comfortably within the limited time available, thereby preserving both comprehensibility and immersion for the audience.

&lt;img width='1299' height='999' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adf44f5f-0519-4bbb-9c30-ff5266968919' /&gt;

In example 8 (see Table 8), Holmes makes an impossible request of his housekeeper Martha, which makes her quite agitated. To convey her impatience and anger, the in-game voice acting is delivered at a very rapid pace with only one pauses after “drop everything”. So, the subtitles not only should the wording be reduced in length to accommodate the speed of delivery, but the frequency of punctuation-based segmentation also needs to be minimised. By doing so, the rhythm of the subtitles can better align with the rapid speech, thereby reinforcing the emotional intensity of the scene. 
In this example, the source text contains multiple clauses joined in sequence, reflecting Martha’s frustration at Holmes’s unreasonable demand. If translated literally into Chinese, the subtitles would be too lengthy for comfortable reading within the limited time available on screen, and the frequent pauses marked by commas in English would make synchronisation with the rapid delivery of the voice acting difficult. Therefore, the multiple procedural steps of “drop everything, go to the shops, acquire additional food” are adapted into a metaphorical expression “就算我是魔法师” (even if I were a magician), which conveys impossibility in a more vivid and simple way. This strategy not only shortens the subtitle to suit the fast-paced delivery but also successfully recreates the pauses in the source text, thereby better matching the rhythm of the audio performance. At the same time, the figurative phrasing intensifies Martha’s emotional state by highlighting her exasperation in a culturally natural and emphatic manner.

#### 4.2.5 Audience-oriented adaptations
The same source text may yield different translations in the contexts of in-game dialogue and live-stream subtitles because of the distinct functions and communicative environments of the two media. In-game text is closely tied to interactivity: it must respond to player actions, provide operational clarity, and maintain immersion within the flow of gameplay. Subtitles, by contrast, are designed for a viewing audience who are not active participants but observers. Therefore, when translating subtitles, it is often necessary to explain and supplement the conditions and objects that trigger the dialogue. As a result, the Skopos of each medium diverges, and this divergence naturally leads to variation in translation strategies. What appears redundant or distracting in a subtitle may be essential in the game, and what is immersive in gameplay may be confusing for viewers without contextual cues. So, recognising these differing communicative purposes of their audience is crucial to understanding why identical source text is rendered differently across the two media.

&lt;img width='1305' height='590' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd13a4d5-3265-4c96-bd64-c191b3d52748' /&gt;

In example 9 (see Table 9), the same source text is translated differently in the game and in the live-stream subtitles. After Watson’s leg injury, if Holmes interacts with his leg by pressing the “Examine” button, this dialogue will be triggered.
In the in-game localisation, Waston’s first sentence is simplified as “别动” (Stop). This is because the players are directly engaged in the interaction that triggers this response, and they are already aware of what action has been performed. Thus, the translation does not need to repeat or clarify the content of interaction. A shorter and more direct form such as “别动” can reinforce immediacy, and strengthens immersion by aligning with the player’s embodied experience.
In contrast, the live-stream audience does not share the player’s interactive perspective and may not immediately understand why Watson suddenly protests if they didn’t notice the previous action in the video. To avoid potential confusion, the subtitles choose to make the object explicit by specifying both the object and the content of this action, and translated it as “别折腾我的腿了” (stop messing with my leg). By pointing out “the leg,” the subtitles provide viewers with sufficient information to grasp the cause of Watson’s reaction, thereby ensuring narrative clarity.
Audience-oriented adaptations highlight the principle that the same line of source text may require divergent treatments depending on the audience’s role and perspective. In-game text prioritises immersion and logical coherence within interactive gameplay, while live-stream subtitles prioritise accessibility and comprehension for non-participatory viewers. Their divergent Skopos therefore demonstrate the translator’s ability to align with the communicative purpose of each medium.


## Chapter 5: Conclusion and Insights
Through the translation practice of _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_, the translator has learned and accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience about the process of game localisation and subtitling. What’s more, the translator have also identified some issues that both industry professionals and game developers often overlook, which may impact localisation quality.
### 5.1 Conclusion
This report has explored the distinctive challenges and strategies involved in translating _The Beekeeper’s Picnic_ across two different media: in-game text and live-stream subtitles. 
Through practice and analysis, it can be found that Skopos Theory plays a guiding role in video game localisation. The game itself is a purposeful communicative behaviour. Different types of games have different purposes, and different types of text in a game also have different functions and purposes (Fang, 2016:103-108). Therefore, when translating video games, it is necessary to help players from different cultural backgrounds have the same game experience by following three rules of Skopos Theory. Only by meeting players’ demands and expectations for the game text can a game be recognised by target players and succeed in the international market.
The comparison between in-game text and live-stream subtitles revealed that the difference in Skopos and readership fundamentally accounts for divergent translation solutions. In-game translation must prioritise functional clarity, immersion, and consistency. Subtitles, by contrast, must accommodate constraints of time and space, synchronise with voice acting, and remain accessible to a broader audience who may lack prior cultural knowledge. As such, subtitles often involve reduction for readability, explicitation to clarify implicit meaning and logical connectives, variation to avoid monotony, and annotations to bridge cultural gaps. The application of Skopos Theory has provided a unifying framework to explain these strategies. The analysis has shown that the functional purpose of each medium determines the appropriate translation choices: coherence and usability for players, clarity and narrative flow for viewers. 
Finally, this study argues that game localisation and live-stream subtitling need be approached with different translation strategies tailored for respective readerships, even when they derive from the same source text. Instead, translators must remain responsive to the communicative purpose, technical constraints, and audience expectations of different medium. 
### 5.2 Insights
One key insight that emerged from this project relates to the technical challenges of working with the dedicated translation editor provided by the AGS game engine. During the translation process, it became clear that the software is far from user-friendly. The editor can only organise text according to the numerical codes assigned to each string in the programme, rather than presenting dialogue in its narrative sequence. As a result, all lines appear in a fragmented and disordered fashion, making it extremely difficult for the translator to reconstruct the precise context in which each utterance occurs. This lack of contextual information creates a significant risk of misunderstanding the intended meaning or tone of dialogue, which in turn may compromise the accuracy and coherence of the translation. More importantly, such issues could have direct consequences for quality assurance and for the eventual release of the localised game. This highlights the need for more translator-oriented tools in game localisation, where contextual awareness is essential to producing accurate, natural, and immersive translations.
The second insight concerns the role of the translator in the practice of game localisation. Rather than remaining a passive recipient of tasks, the translator should exercise agency and actively contribute to the success of the project. This means not only carrying out the whole process of translation and localisation, but also engaging with the broader communicative and promotional goals of the product itself. For instance, in this project, the translator proposed to the developers the idea of producing a live-stream video as a promotional strategy. Furthermore, during the subtitling process, the translator modified the translation to the knowledge and cultural background of Chinese audiences by adding concise annotations and supplementary information where necessary. These interventions proved highly effective in enhancing the promotional impact of the live-stream and demonstrated the value of a translator’s initiative in shaping the reception of a localised game.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; The following is a transcript of my talk as a guest speaker on the roundtable episode of the translation &amp; game localisation podcast _Source 2 Target_. In this session, I shared my thoughts on the Chinese localisation of one of my recent favorite games, _Disco Elysium_, focusing on its unique narrative style and the challenges and highlights of translating such a text-heavy, philosophically rich title for a Chinese-speaking audience.

&lt;br/&gt;

## Introduction 
　 _Disco Elysium_ is a groundbreaking role-playing game (RPG) developed by an Estonian studio named ZA/UM. Upon release in 2019, the game has caused a sensation by winning multiple industry-recognized and prestigious awards as a debut work of an unknown independent studio, including Best Narrative and Best Role-Playing Game at **The Game Awards (TGA) 2019[1]**. Set in an imaginative war-torn city of Revachol, players assume the role of an amnesiac detective tasked with solving a murder with limited time and various restrictions.
　On game design, _Disco Elysium_ is widely recognized for its unconventional approach and its exceptional use of language. (Robertson, 2024) Rather than relying on traditional RPG mechanics like combat or leveling through enemies, there are only two core gameplay mechanics: first, manipulating the protagonist to engage in rich and dense dialogues with the game characters and also himself to uncover the truth behind the murder and the whole world-setting; and second, making critical decisions at key plot junctures only via highly randomized results of cyber dice rolls. These designs reflect the game’s strong emphasis on narratology over ludology, with the former seeing games as narratives and representations, the latter focusing on the play action dimensions of games (O’Hagan &amp; Mangiron, 2013).
　Intertextuality, which referred to the text construction as a mosaic of quotations, absorption and transformation from other texts (Kristeva, 1986) is also another important feature of this game. Recently, intertextuality also became an ever-present phenomenon in video games to connect to real history, literature, philosophy, and other media (Duret, 2017). The fundamental framework and the game stage design in _Disco Elysium_ drew extensive references to real-world historical and political events, such as the French Revolution, the communist Soviet Union, and the political upheavals in Eastern Europe. It also incorporates a wide range of political-philosophical ideologies as undertones of the game, including capitalism, communism, liberalism, imperialism, moralism, and fascism etc. Therefore, the magical realist style of game-setting, combined with its rich and sophisticated ideological undertones, further elevates the level of interpretive complexity for players. 
　Besides, the game language is also complicated, florid, philosophical, and often poetic—drawing comparisons to literary fiction rather than standard video game writing. Such game language also poses challenges for players. Non-native English speakers, in particular, have noted the difficulty in navigating the game's extensive vocabulary and nuanced dialogues. One player remarked on Reddit, “I had to take my time and re-read entire sentences three, four times sometimes”. Similarly, a discussion on Steam highlighted that even players from English-speaking countries found themselves consulting dictionaries to fully grasp the text. 
　Despite the considerable challenges posed by the game's complexity in both the understanding and language of the game, the localisation team of WhisperGames delivered a successful Chinese localisation that received overall positive comments by players across major Chinese gamer online platforms such as GCORES, the NGA forum, and the review section on the Steam platform. **Comments consistently praised the translation for its fluency, clarity, accuracy, and stylistic elegance—clearly distinguishing it from machine translation[2]**.  Players have also expressed appreciation for the localisation team’s outstanding work, which enabled them to access and engage with such a textually dense and conceptually challenging game, but which possesses ideological depth and narrative quality. Completing such a huge localisation project of over one million words within four months is also considered as a remarkable achievement in the field of English-Chinese game localisation. But unfortunately, certain loss in the Chinese localisation of _Disco Elysium_ still prevails due to cultural and linguistic reasons.
　In the following two sections, I will give several representative examples to illustrate the inevitable loss and sophisticated creation in the process of game localisation. Because of technical issues, i.e. unable to conduct text extraction and frequency analysis for the game texts with over one million words, the essay will mainly adopt a qualitative approach.

## Inevitable loss in _Disco Elysium_ Chinese localisation
　It is commonplace that something is always lost in translation. Early theorists acknowledged that no translation can perfectly replicate all aspects of the original. Eugene Nida (1975) noted that “all types of translation involve (1) loss of information, (2) addition of information, and/or (3) skewing of information”. Catford (1965) defined untranslatability through two aspects: linguistic and cultural, where the failure to find a target language (TL) equivalent lies either in the linguistic differences between the source language (SL) and target language, or in the absence of a functionally relevant feature in the SL. Therefore, wordplays, idioms, local customs and institutions in the ST often cause barriers to the transformation into the target language, which is also the case in game localisation.
　However, the case for _Disco Elysium_ is slightly different. The most prominent loss during the localisation will be the lingual diversity in the original game language. The intonations that manifested in certain language itself, the pragmatic information they convey and the associations they raise are culturally marked, just as Venuti (2004) put it, “Social and regional dialects, ..., and foreign borrowings tend to be language-specific, unlikely to travel well, their peculiar force difficult to render into other languages.” Therefore, in game localisation practices, geographical dialects are generally neutralized in translation (Mangiron 2007), resulting in inevitable loss in translation process. 
　_Disco Elysium_ was originally produced and released exclusively in English; however, it features a significant presence of other foreign languages such as French, Spanish, Italian, and Finnish, embedded throughout the game via both voice acting and textual elements. **For native English-speaking players, this multilingualism is easily perceptible[3]**, allowing players to have direct preservations of diverse origins of the game characters. Besides, discussions of the function and representation of the non-English contents have also been stimulated in the game community. These discussions often revolve around how the game took references of the countries in real world speaking these languages—such as the **French Revolution[4]**, which not only enriched the understanding to the game, but also created opportunities for exchanges outside the gameplay that in turn enrich the gaming experience. In contrast, during the localisation process into Chinese, such linguistic diversity was erased. For Chinese players who lack proficiency in English or other foreign languages, it became difficult to detect the game’s multilingual nature therefore to intuitively grasp the nature of the fictional setting of the game as a turbulent melting pot. As a result, they may miss out on the layered cultural complexity that English-speaking players experience more directly. 
　Moreover, the non-English languages in the game also caused difficulty or even impossibility to transfer puns generated through the multilinguilism of the game into Chinese. One such example is the translation about a character’s name: “Call Me Mañana” is translated to “叫我马列拉”. In the Chinese translation, the localisation team transliterated the name “Mañana” to “马列拉”, rendering “call me” as “call me by the name of (叫我)”, which is straightforward. However, the Spanish word mañana also means “tomorrow,” allowing players who are familiar with Spanish to interpret it as a potential pun when considered alongside the character’s identity and personality. This character is portrayed as a laid-back, philosophically inclined dockworker who is notably unmotivated to work. If we keep the original meaning of “mañana” in Spanish and interpret “call me” not as a name introduction but as a request for “give me a call,” the entire phrase could be reinterpreted as “Call me tomorrow.” This alternative reading cleverly aligns with the character’s lazy, procrastinatory characteristics, adding a layer of humor and playful implication like “Don’t bother me today. Call me tomorrow”. 
　Although the game’s creators have not explicitly confirmed whether this name was intended as a pun, such player-driven interpretation enriches the comedic dimension and enhances the overall engagement of players with the game. Unfortunately, this kind of linguistic playfulness is lost in the Chinese transliteration, although being the most authoritive  and conventional approach in translation of foreign names or appellations in Chinese (Xu 2024), which is a regrettable limitation for failing to convey the cross-linguistic nuance and humor within the game.

&lt;br/&gt;

## Examples of widely praised transcreation in _Disco Elysium_
　As an emerging type of translation, video game localisation is beyond simply translating on-screen text. It is a user-centered type of translation that can be framed within functionalist paradigms of translation, whereby the translation process is shaped by the intended purpose or function of the target text (Nord 1997). The main goal of game localisation is to create a functional localised version with a similar look and feel as the original game that produces a similar effect on target players, as if it were a game originally developed for them (O’Hagan &amp; Mangiron 2006). Therefore, the localisation decisions often depend on a new set of user environments with specific linguistic, cultural, and technical implications. (O’Hagan &amp; Mangiron, 2013), which allows game localisers to enjoy a degree of creative freedom far beyond that of other translators. Thus, the term of “transcreation” holds important position in game translation, highlighting that translators are empowered to modify, omit, or add elements to enhance player enjoyment (ibid). The localisation team sometimes even invented lines that didn’t exist in the source texts – effectively a new literary creation – to elicit the intended player reaction. This can be seen as a loss of the original reference, but a gain in audience connection, especially under the context of prioritizing the equivalence of player experience after the transition of game language. 
　There are many exemplary cases of successful transcreation in the Chinese localisation of _Disco Elysium_. For example, the localisation of the names of two non-playable characters (NPCs) in the game—portrayed as young, offbeat hooligans with vulgar speaking style—has been widely appreciated by Chinese players for its humorous and inventive adaptation with a doggerel style. A table chart is provided below to show the source text (ST), the translation, and the back translation (BT) of the Chinese translation with clarity. 
&lt;img width='1203' height='207' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04c003f0-1504-4f25-b8af-7c37da6c884b' /&gt;
　It can be said that the typographical choice of employing capitalization in the original English texts not only distinguishes them from ordinary vulgar lines but rather to be character identifiers, it also foreshadows the uniqueness of the ensuing scene—the exchange between the protagonist and the two young hooligans is quite engaging and humorous in the game.
However, the Chinese localisation went even further, not only incorporating elements of the target culture but also enhancing the original text’s literary quality and humor. In fact, it is hard to produce a back translation that fully captures the creative adaptation achieved by the Chinese localisation in its native linguistic and cultural context. Firstly, the Chinese localisation of these two relatively simple English names were substantially expanded, incorporating several new meanings that absent from the original. Each translation begins with a four-character idiom, adding a literary feature to the translation while establishing a parallel structure between the two translations. This stylistic embellishment does not conflict with the characters’ personas; on the contrary, it may reflect a subcultural tendency toward exaggerated, non-mainstream behavior of street thugs, for they may flaunt a kind of pseudo-literary flair. 
　Moreover, the translation mitigates the offensiveness of the original’s blunt vulgarities, which aligns more to the stricter censorship in Chinese market. For example, “fuck” is translated as “干翻,” which is a more moderated rendering in Chinese, while “PISS” is humorously transformed into “取一尿饮 (take a sip of piss)”, further enriching the line with vividity and playfulness. The cumulative effect of these skillful choices significantly enhances the humor and entertainment value of the translation—arguably even surpassing the original, achieving the “emotional localisation” that facilitates target players’ immersion in the game (Díaz Montón, 2010, qtd. in Mangiron, 2016). The localised character names have been widely praised by Chinese players, frequently mentioned in scattered online posts discussing the game’s localisation quality. Such positive receptions reflect the success of this transcreation, which left a deep impression on the players and stands as a testament to the translator’s creativity and cultural sensitivity. 
&lt;br/&gt;
　Except from the above example, there is another example of a successful transcreation in _Disco Elysium_’s Chinese localisation, with the in-game context provided below. The lines in italic in both ST and translation are corresponding that analysis will be conducted.

&lt;img width='1376' height='483' alt='Image' src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03319191-00b8-4048-808b-da04854d5d16' /&gt;

　In this part of the story, a group of young people aspiring to build an anodic music club within an abandoned church helped a programmer to use their sound equipment for her experiment. The original line of the character EGGHEAD was rich in rhetorical devices, utilizing both alliterations to amplify its sound and rhythm, and parallel structure to reinforce its thematic emphasis. These stylistic elements, however, pose significant challenges for translators to preserve both the rhetorical form and humorous elements of the original.
　The translation of “Pump it to the brick, pump it to the hard master!” was produced largely out of creation, with references to lyrics of one popular Chinese rap song: “野狼Disco (Wild Wolf Disco)” Released in 2019, the song quickly went virus online due to its catchy rhythm, humorous lyrics, and unique musical style. The widespread popularity of this track was also proved by its performances on major stages, including the CCTV Spring Festival Gala. 
　Under the background of the widespread popularity of the song “Wild Wolf Disco” during the same year (2019) of the localisation work, and in consideration of the thematic similarity between the anodic music and Wild Wolf Disco—both being popular and novel among the youth, the localisation team creatively adapted a line from the song’s iconic chorus. The original lyrics—“左手” (on your left) and “右手” (on your right)—form a parallel structure that mirrors the rhetorical techniques of the English source text. The translators also paid attention to preserving the meaning reference in the original source while localising it in a culturally resonant manner. they added the word “硬核” (hardcore), a concept central to both anodic music in game and EGGHEAD’s character on the lyrical foundation. This localised version has since become one of the most prominent and memorable examples of transcreation in _Disco Elysium_ among Chinese players. It is still frequently mentioned in online discussions by new players today, who express a sense of surprise and cultural intimacy upon encountering a familiar cultural element after reading the game’s otherwise dense and stream-of-consciousness texts. This is a good example echoing to Alvarenga’s (2019) highlights of the significance of linguistic fluency and cultural familiarity in enhancing player immersion through localisation, which plays a critical role in videogames, being responsible for making them positively memorable and offering a unique experience. 
　However, the author would also like to raise the question of whether such a high degree of transcreation leads only to positive influence. In the example discussed above, it becomes apparent that the use of parallel structure in the original ST was intended to convey a clear response to SOONA, THE PROGRAMMER’s question: namely, “yes and turn the volume all the way up!” This core meaning, however, is not explicitly preserved in the transcreated version, failing to the deliver basic mission of translation of “conveying meanings”. Moreover, the translator’s choice to adapt this song lyrics also implicitly assigns a specific characterization to the “anodic music” in the game, which may not be entirely appropriate or consistent with the original. The ambiguous and stream-of-consciousness narrative style in _Disco Elysium_ leaves considerable room for free interpretation of players, which only associated the anodic music to generalized adjective like “love” and “hardcore”. The fixed cultural tone and stylistic qualities of “Wild Wolf Disco” may not fully align with the open and abstract nature of anodic music as originally portrayed.
　In this case, it seems that sometimes the transcreation or adaptation in game localisation may tend to an extreme extent, posing impact on the gameplay experience by breaking the suspension of disbelief of game players. It is important to for the translator to bear in mind “the unavoidable release of meanings that work only in the translating language” (Venuti 2004), and make more cautious and contemplated decisions.

## Conclusion 
　Video game localisers operate on a creative tightrope, where every choice simultaneously incurs a loss and offers a potential gain. On one side lies the ineffable: the untranslatable cultural essences, the rhetorical devices like jokes and puns, the historically bound meanings that inevitably slip away in another language. On the other side lies the inventive spark: the translator’s ability to bring a new life into a text, to craft a work that resonates in the target language and culture, sometimes in ways the original never could. As Jakobson observed, translation of art is not a mere reproduction but a “creative transposition”. In the realm of games, it might mean a localised game becomes a beloved version. As Peter Searls eloquently puts it, the translator’s ultimate freedom is “to move beyond mere equivalence, to translate how a text communicates rather than simply what it says”. Exercising this freedom with skill and sensitivity is what transforms translation from a process of loss into an act of literary creation.

&lt;br/&gt;&#13;

&#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; By comparing **parallel texts of English translations of the same event - The death of Patroclus**, it can be seen that there are aesthetic differences between individualism and tragedy in Homeric and Virgilian Epic. It discusses the Virgilian paradox, an epic of drama and pathos that goes back to the origins of modern debate on Virgil in the Romantic period, where the supposed **natural primitivism and fresh naivete of Homer** was commonly and unfavourably contrasted with the **more artificial and sophisticated Virgilian epic**. &#13;
&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&gt; It argues that Virgil too sensed from the beginning that the naturalness and noble simplicity of Homer was essentially irrecoverable in the cultural context of the first century BC, but that he had the opportunity to create a Homer for his own times. It also charts the quintessential ambiguity of the Aeneid, both reflecting the **traditionally nationalistic ideology of Roman epic in the steps of Naevius and Ennius**, and **showing an extraordinary empathy with the focalisations and feelings of individual characters**, many of whom represent a point of view at odds with the direction of the nationalistic plot.&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&#13;
## The death of Patroclus: Homer, _Iliad_ 16.751–867&#13;
&gt; From ancient Greek into English &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IL.16.751   He spoke so, and strode against the [hero](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3383) Kebriones&#13;
[IL.16.752](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16752)   with the [spring](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=5082) of a [lion](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3780), who as he ravages the [pastures](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=4259)&#13;
[IL.16.753](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16753)   has been hit in the [chest](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=2060), and [his own](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=1063) [courage](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=2256) destroys him.&#13;
IL.16.754   So in your [fury](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3048) you pounced, Patroklos, above Kebriones.&#13;

&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&#13;
## The death of Pallas: Virgil, _Aeneid_ 10.439–509&#13;
&gt; From Latin into English&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile the kind nymph sent her brother Turnus &#13;
To Lausus’ aid. He sped his chariot 				&#13;
Through the line and told his comrades, “Now stand down. &#13;
Pallas belongs to me. I’ll go for him. &#13;
I only wish his father could look on.” &#13;
He spoke. His comrades quit the field as ordered. &#13;
With the Rutulians gone, the youth, transfixed 		&#13;
By the haughty orders, let his hard gaze rove &#13;
From a distance over Turnus’ massive form. &#13;
He gave this answer to the tyrant’s words: &#13;
“Either’s a glorious prize: a general’s armor &#13;
Or death. It makes no difference to my father. 		&#13;
So stop your threats.” He stepped into the open, &#13;
Freezing the blood in the Arcadians’ hearts. &#13;
Turnus jumped down and closed in on his prey &#13;
On foot. A lion on his lofty post &#13;
Sees a bull lunging on a distant plain 		     	                                            &#13;
And hurtles toward him: Turnus looked like this. &#13;
Pallas first gauged his spear’s range, then stepped forward, &#13;
Calling on the huge sky in hope that chance &#13;
Would bless his bravery against the odds. &#13;
“Hercules, come—my father took you in, 			                                    &#13;
A stranger—help in this great enterprise. &#13;
Let dying Turnus see his bloody weapons &#13;
Taken from him by my victorious hands.” &#13;
The god heard, but he stifled heavy groans &#13;
In his heart; the tears were futile that he shed. 		                                   &#13;
To comfort him, his father, Jupiter, &#13;
Said this: “An end is set for everyone, &#13;
For life is brief and cannot be recovered. &#13;
But brave men, through their exploits, strive for fame &#13;
That lasts. Beneath Troy’s high walls many sons 		                                   &#13;
Of gods died. My own child Sarpedon died there.&#13;
Fate calls: for Turnus too the race is ending.” &#13;
He turned his eyes away from Italy’s fields. &#13;
Pallas with all his great strength cast his spear &#13;
And snatched his bright sword from the hollow sheath. 	                           &#13;
The spear flew, pierced the layers of the shield, &#13;
And struck the breastplate at the shoulder’s rim, &#13;
Finally grazing Turnus’ massive form. &#13;
But he in turn deliberately aimed &#13;
His iron-pointed pike and launched it, saying, 		                                   &#13;
“See if my weapon is the one to stick.&#13;
The spearhead, striking, shaking, pounded through &#13;
The shield—all of the bronze and iron sheets, &#13;
All of the bull-hide layers wrapping it— &#13;
Into the breastplate, into that strong chest. 			                                   &#13;
Out of the wound he tore the heated shaft, &#13;
But with it came his lifeblood and his soul. &#13;
Collapsing forward with a crash of arms, &#13;
He touched the enemy earth with gory lips. &#13;
Turnus stood over him: 					                                                  &#13;
“Go tell Evander this, Arcadians: &#13;
I send him back the Pallas he deserves. &#13;
The soothing tribute of a burial I grant him. &#13;
But he had a costly guest— Aeneas.” &#13;
With his foot he held the corpse down 			                                          &#13;
And stripped the giant swordbelt with its story  &#13;
Of crime etched in—a wedding night that left &#13;
The bedrooms smeared with gore of slaughtered youths— &#13;
That Clonus, son of Eurytus, had embossed &#13;
In gold, and Turnus now was thrilled to loot. 			                         &#13;
People know nothing of their fated future. &#13;
Their exaltation cannot stay in bounds. &#13;
The time would come when he’d give anything &#13;
Not to have touched the boy. He’d hate his plunder, &#13;
And hate this day. Pallas’ friends pressed in, wailing. 	                                 &#13;
They laid him on his shield to haul away.&#13;
What grief, what glory you will take your father! &#13;
A single day brought war and death to you. &#13;
But see the heaps of enemy dead you leave.&#13;

The most relevant piece for our session is Ch. 1 of [Barchiesi 2015](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvkc7) (on JSTOR) ‘THE DEATH OF PALLAS. Intertextuality and Transformation of the Epic Model&#13;

Abstract: In this study I shall try to indicate how Vergil has in fact incorporated the whole Iliad and the whole Odyssey into the Aeneid, incomparably transforming the Homeric epics. I must start with a few methodological considerations. I shall then seek to explain the relation of some of the most important passages of the Aeneid to their Homeric counterparts. Finally I shall try to suggest how we ought to understand this grand poetical contest.&#13;

* A challenge of meaning itself   &#13;
* Linguistic irrationality   &#13;
* “To be a Dadaist is perhaps to be more of a businessman, more of a politician than an artist – or to be an artist only by accident to be a Dadaist is to be turned and tossed by events, to resist petrifaction”  &#13;
* The meaning of being an artist is defined by constant innovation and disruption &#13;

Hyperinflation &#13;
&#13;
How does Dada reflect capitalism rather than oppose it?  &#13;
Dada's anti-moralism began to directly reflect capitalist nihilism. Capitalist nihilism, however, is the valorisation process of capital value swallowing, progressively, all (cultural, normative, moral) values that are not capitalist yet. The avant-gardes' 'brave' move against morals, in this sense, was as “untimely” as Nietzsche's same move a few decades earlier. The only thing left to do after this delving into cynicism was to follow a cosmologically conceived naïve anarchism for which the end of self-determination equals the end of domination, since subjectivity is nothing but a disciplining function, and conscience nothing but a fatherly super-ego. Of course, such 'anarchism' must pretend that no societal infrastructure would be left after one withdrew from one's conscious, conscientious, responsive autonomy – as if desire or fantasy were somehow 'outside' of (consumerist\!) society. Without a doubt, today's art world is dominated by this cynical version of “anarchism”, and its hegemony mimics capital's valorising devalorisation – or capitalist nihilism.&#13;

  * If modernism was abt formalism, thinking about the nature of painting and fragmented bodies, at this moment we have a set of different concerns   &#13;
  * Is abstraction esoteric and inaccesible or is it a challenge to the idea that art can be easily instrumentalized by the fascist regime bc its not didactic   &#13;

      2. Not a state mandated style, coming from artists who have a certain political belief (unlike socialist realism)  &#13;
   2. Mexican mural movement   &#13;
3. Artists who had been making more abstrac work return to figuration, movement away from fragmentation of figures  &#13;

&#13;
**Impressionism**  &#13;

#### 1/18 Modernism &amp; The female Nude: Picasso's Les demoiselles d' Avigonon&#13;
&#13;
**Context:**   &#13;
1907  &#13;
How the painting represents the relationship between the female nude and modernism  &#13;
History of western art and the Renaissance   &#13;
Immediate context in which Picasso made this painting   &#13;
General reception of the painting &#13;
&#13;
Picasso:&#13;
&#13;
- Known as the inventor of cubism   &#13;
- Known for Guernica (anti-war painting in 1937\)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
- Picasso skilled at naturalism, creating an image that looks lifelike   &#13;
- An opportunity to think about abstraction   &#13;
- Abstraction is about deconstruction of representation   &#13;
- A result of specific set of choices &#13;
&#13;
Within the western tradition, long history of images/ sculpture of nude figures   &#13;
At the center of Greek art was the male nude (Michelangelo’s David; Antonio’s Perseus)&#13;
&#13;
- Male figure \- heroic   &#13;
- The accurate depiction of male nude \- highest level of artist achievement &#13;
&#13;
In contrast, female nude:&#13;
&#13;
- Nude image of female had an erotic function   &#13;
- William Hogarth, Marriagea la Mode: curtain drawn over a female nude bc it’s so overly erotic   &#13;
- Titles like: sleeping venus; Rokeby Venus; the Toilette of Venus (god of love) \-\&gt; a mythological pretext for her nudity  &#13;
- Distort female body to show more nudity  &#13;
- Emerged in the context of italian renaissance that insisted upon the gap of the functions of male and female nudity &#13;
&#13;
Edouard Manuet \- broke the historical tradition &#13;
&#13;
- Olympia, 1863 (referencing Venus of Urbino) \- first modernist painting   &#13;
  - Depicts the modern life  &#13;
  - Declares the surface of painting, acknowledges the existence of the canvas   &#13;
  - Frankness of her stare suggests a transactional relationship btw viewers of the painting and her  &#13;
  - Flowers brought to her by a woman who’s her servant (African descent) from her next client   &#13;
- A hinge btw the history of reclining female nude and its modern iteration  &#13;
- Deliberately updates the figure, no longer a mythological figure of Venus but explicitly a modern sex worker   &#13;
- The way in which he compressed the space (compared to Venus of Urbino) \- darkness → shallow background, brightness of white presses forward   &#13;
  - Establishes a precedent of avant garde shock that happens through the female nude&#13;
&#13;
Paul Gauguin, Copy of Manuet’s Olympia 1891&#13;
&#13;
- A deliberate conversation   &#13;
- Modernism is worked through the body of female nude  &#13;
    &#13;
  Sex workers/ women, an emblem of modernism “The New Woman”  &#13;
- The beautiful girl 1919  &#13;
- Street, berlin, 1913&#13;
&#13;
Paul Cezanne, The large bathers, 1906&#13;
&#13;
- He challenges the fundamental assumptions of naturalism  &#13;
- Ex: this work depicts the real world but also presents itself as a painting through  &#13;
  - The breaking open of form (the distortion of tree branches; the relationship between the trunk and the sky)&#13;
&#13;
Matisse paints Bonheur de vive (in conversation w the painting above)&#13;
&#13;
- Abstraction  &#13;
- Emptying out of form  &#13;
- Emphasis on outline  &#13;
- Discrete scenes: idealized and pastoral   &#13;
- Trying to create a modern, classical grandeur   &#13;
- Pleasing to look at&#13;
&#13;
Gertrude Stein: hangs up this painting, seen by Picasso   &#13;
Picasso was in the process of painting the portrait of Gertrude Stein, saw Matisse’s painting as a challenge and came up w Les Demoiselles d Avignon  &#13;
&#13;
- The painting of Gertrude Stein reflects his interest in form&#13;
&#13;
**Les Demoiselles d Avignon** (Symbolic of Picasso’s misogyny and racism)  &#13;
No pastoral setting, no bright colors  &#13;
everything is angular    &#13;
Red light district in Barcelona (Spanish sex workers)  &#13;
Shallow space → compression achieved through a lack of background detail; a tangled of bodies; disproportion of faces  &#13;
stylistic dysjunction (multiple styles happening in one painting)&#13;
&#13;
- Faces resemble → Dan mask; Baule mask → signifies Africaness/ a monstrosity&#13;
&#13;
Flatness of figures   &#13;
Presence of a reclining figure (second on the left)&#13;
&#13;
- Makes more sense if she were to be lying down  &#13;
- Rendering her hinged up at the viewers  &#13;
- Further compresses the space, a furthering of abstraction  &#13;
- What does that achieve?   &#13;
  - The figure becomes confrontational   &#13;
  - Gazes are multiplied (compared to Olympia), extending the dialogue  &#13;
  - Olympia confronts the everyday male viewer w his own practices of sexuality and how that’s comodified   &#13;
  - Whereas Picasso is aiming to further the shock factor, to further highlight to the male viewers the banality of the everyday life; updates a classic genre, intentionally   &#13;
    - Through the extension of flattening, the multiplication of gazes  &#13;
- Figure on the very left  &#13;
  - Holding open a curtain for viewers to survey her body&#13;
&#13;
Nowhere for the eyes to go, attention gets thrown back to the foreground  &#13;
(white and black are used to render volume, which the painting lacks)  &#13;
The fruit at the bottom of the canvas &#13;
&#13;
- Putting viewers at the table, engaging with and confronting the women directly&#13;
&#13;
Understood as a formal innovation that led to Cubism &#13;
&#13;
Primitivism in 20th C.: Western writers conceive the cultural other as an authenticity, as a sight of other than themselves, rather than reflecting about the differences &#13;
&#13;
Ringgold, Picasso’s Studio&#13;
&#13;
- Picasso becomes a side character in the story of modernism &#13;
&#13;
#### 1/23 Post-Impressionism (Continue)&#13;
&#13;
Divisionism: reflecting on the division of plane into infinite dots  &#13;
Pointillism &#13;
&#13;
- Two directions that artists go to engage w colors (differentiation vs synthesis) &#13;
&#13;
###### *Georges Seurat*&#13;
&#13;
Interested in scientific approach to color, to bringing stability and classical quality to impressionism   &#13;
And thinking about class in the contemporary context&#13;
&#13;
* Bathers at Asnieres 1884  &#13;
  * Working class leisure   &#13;
  * Lower class status  &#13;
  * Context: Pastoral, mythological settings of traditional bather paintings   &#13;
* Sunday Afternoon 1884  &#13;
  * Middle class leisure   &#13;
  * Mature style → more dotted    &#13;
* Le chahut 1889  &#13;
  * Performance as a social context, not an image of performance isolated from its context Create opportunities for a rich patterning of colors → stability of subject, contradicts the content  &#13;
  * Stability vs. movement (classism, solemnity)  &#13;
* Parade de cirque 1887  &#13;
  * Bourgeois, leisure, at night &#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Influential figure for the development of cubism, not totally post impressionist bc approach looks very different from impressionist   &#13;
Breaking open closed form&#13;
&#13;
* Still Life w Basket of apples 1893  &#13;
  * Stuffy genre → still life   &#13;
  * Creating a scene w multiple diff perspectives   &#13;
  * Edge of table doesn’t line up, the corners don’t match  &#13;
  * Thick application of paint for napkin: Creating a sense of structure, of folds  &#13;
  * Overall composition: disorienting   &#13;
    * Trying to paint in a way that reflect the way our eyes engage w paintings → not linear, not single point perspective; our eyes wander around   &#13;
    * Breaking the standard criteria of composition since Renaissance which is the idea of a unified image (→ painting has to present one thing from one view) \- Deconstruction of tradition   &#13;
    * Representation vs reality: how painting constructs representation   &#13;
    * Interested in the materiality of color; Brush strokes: constructing forms w paint   &#13;
* Mont sainte Victoire 1885  &#13;
  * Disintegration of form   &#13;
  * Lack of outline: truck of tree vs un outlined zone next to it  &#13;
  * Recession of space, tree established a sense of distance   &#13;
* Mont Sainte Victoire 1902  &#13;
  * Repeated patches of color \- pixelated \- sit on the surface of the canvas   &#13;
  * Stacked up vertically, no sense of space   &#13;
  * Bleeding of forms \- breaking open of form itself; form isn’t a coherent thing, designated by outlines or not; Key principle that Cezanne is challenging   &#13;
  * Analysis of representation through the materiality of painting   &#13;
* The Large Bathers 1906  &#13;
* Bathers 1894-1905  &#13;
  * Drawing on a tradition of scenes of bathers   &#13;
    * idealized natural setting, mythological context (Diana and Callisto 1635; Pastoral Symphony 1510\)  &#13;
    * Bathing: pretext for nudity   &#13;
  * Cezanne and Seurat continue the tradition  &#13;
    * Interest in using new techniques to engage traditional subjects &#13;
&#13;
Impressionists: Momentarily experience w naturalism   &#13;
Post impressionist: artist capture their own experience in a subjective way &#13;
&#13;
- Everyone is motivated by the desire to access truth, to make a painting that feels true and real, whether its through personal temperament or objective perspective   &#13;
- Idea of Expressionism is emerging &#13;
&#13;

&#13;
After 1911, Matisse engaged w cubism   &#13;
View of Notre Dame 1914  &#13;
The Piano Lesson 1916  &#13;
Dance II  &#13;
Swimming Pool 1952: Using cutouts, papers and scissors as his primary medium&#13;
&#13;
- Collapses into just the surface (color as shape) &#13;
&#13;
#### 1/25 Cubism&#13;
&#13;
Understand and recognize the differences between synthetic cubism &amp; analytic cubism   &#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; Synthetic: incorporation of external materials&#13;
&gt; Analytic: 1912 near abstraction&#13;
&#13;
Braque &amp; Picasso collaboration (ended by WW1) 1908-1914  &#13;
Analytic Cubism 1909-1912  &#13;
Synthetic Cubism 1912-1915  &#13;
Avant-garde movement based in Paris – significant influence in development of abstraction&#13;
&#13;
* counterpoint to Fauvism – which was about color, but Cubism is about form  &#13;
* external material incorporated into the painting&#13;
&#13;
Representation: from likeness to signification &#13;
&#13;
* Rejecting the idea of what art is – it doesn’t exist on a surface; it’s not decorative   &#13;
* Analysis of the nature of representation   &#13;
  * Representation: Imitation of likeness   &#13;
  * You can describe something that help viewers conjure their own image (there are non representational mode of painting)  &#13;
  * From the iconic to the linguistic mode of representation  &#13;
    * The signifer and the signified (the relationship is arbitrary) &#13;
&#13;
Collage&#13;
&#13;
Picasso &#13;
&#13;
* Move from naturalism to impressionism (date?)  &#13;
* Blue Period 1902  &#13;
* Rose Period 1905 (post-impressionism)  &#13;
* Interest in Iberian sculpture 1905-1906&#13;
&#13;
Matisse – abstract portraiture – both relate and opposite of Picasso &#13;
&#13;
* Achieve abstraction through:  &#13;
  * Matisse: Happen through non-naturalistic color   &#13;
  * Picasso: Transformation of form   &#13;
    * Conceptually more challenging than distortion of color   &#13;
  * Reintegration the debate between line and color  &#13;
* Continued use of Iberian mask late 1906   &#13;
* Culminates in Demoiselles 1907&#13;
&#13;
Braque *Houses at L’Estaque 1908* &#13;
&#13;
* What gave cubism the name   &#13;
* Digesting the lessons of Picasso and Cezanne  &#13;
  * Vs. *Mont Sainte Victoire* by Cezanne  &#13;
  * A more limited color palette, a simplification of form   &#13;
  * No sky, horizon line, creates a feeling of the form spilling forward rather than receding back   &#13;
  * The shading is not working in the opposite way  &#13;
    * Typically the light is closer to the audience and the shadow is further away   &#13;
    * Creating the sense that the volume is concave instead of convex &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Three Women* 1908&#13;
&#13;
* Every form is a triangle  &#13;
* Less cubes than facets   &#13;
* the different placement of the uniformed units signified the object – gets into the question of signification →  triangle in and of itself doesn’t indicate elbows but the placement of them created an elbow  &#13;
  * Relational model of meaning &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *The Reservoir Horta de Ebro 1909*  &#13;
Picasso *Houses on the hill horta de Ebro 1909*&#13;
&#13;
* Picasso digesting lessons from Cezanne  &#13;
* Shapes being relational   &#13;
* Seeing things from multiple perspectives on one plane all at the same time  &#13;
* Faceting of planes   &#13;
* Where we start to get into analytical cubism   &#13;
* Legibility of the structure of the subject starts to vanish over the next year or so&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Girl with a Mandolin 1910*&#13;
&#13;
* Geometric rendering of a human body  &#13;
* Also a rendering of shadow and light, line and plane as themselves arbitrary   &#13;
* Rather than producing likeness, representation through system of signification &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Braque *Violin and Palette* 1909&#13;
&#13;
* Playing w the same idea  &#13;
* Multiple perspective:  access to the front and the side at the same time   &#13;
* Structuring of the backgroun such that it occupies the same plane as the object  &#13;
* Cubism: a lot of musical instrument → reduced to their symbols    &#13;
* The nail on the top:  &#13;
  * Supporting the painter’s palette   &#13;
  * The shadow has a surprising legibility at this stage of Cubism  &#13;
  * Moment of trompe l’oeil   &#13;
    * Trick of the eye, convincing illusionism → something as occupying our space   &#13;
    * Another register of representation   &#13;
    * The nail could be actually piercing the painting and leaving a shadow on the canvas &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Standing Female Nude 1910*&#13;
&#13;
* Not interested in non-representation, or non objective   &#13;
* Will always remain engaged with representation, at the limit of representation   &#13;
* Interest of *the Three Women* repeated but extended   &#13;
* Lines don’t depict anything, but indicate bodies in the context, shading itself rendered arbitary&#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Kahnweiler* *1910*&#13;
&#13;
* Shimmer of facets   &#13;
* Vs. *Girl w a mandolin*  &#13;
* One figure but there’s repetition of the subject; multiple zones of figuration &#13;
&#13;
Braque *The Portuguese* 1911&#13;
&#13;
* A man standing on a dock, playing guitar   &#13;
* He has a lil mustache ahahah so cute\!  &#13;
* Radical reduction of form, of color palette, of shadow and line   &#13;
* Color and shading don’t designate form but rather cursory outlines do&#13;
&#13;
Picaso *Ma Jolie* 1911&#13;
&#13;
* Introduction of lettering → pointing us to collage   &#13;
* Title also a name of a popular song   &#13;
* Picasso’s most abstract painting   &#13;
* Reduction of form to intermittent grid w a general triangle format to indicate a body  &#13;
* Vs. the Red Studio (Fauvism): Achieving flatness through totally different means  &#13;
  * Matisse: playing w color to create a flat decorative quality  &#13;
  * Picasso: interested in the nature of representation through arbitrariness &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Still Life w Chair Canning* 1912&#13;
&#13;
* Oil cloth pasted onto the canvas  &#13;
* Outline of a thick rope   &#13;

  * *Jou* representing newspaper → mass production &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Guitar* 1912&#13;
&#13;
* Vs. Grebo Mask  &#13;
  * Eyes protruding; signified through a presence rather than absence   &#13;
* Similarly, the cylinder stands in for the whole   &#13;
  * An understanding of the sign  &#13;
    * A statement of the arbitrariness of sign in a visual medium  &#13;
    * While the cylinder is represented in an opposite mode, it’s immediately understood by the view   &#13;
    * Bois: Historicizing the formal structure of the work   &#13;
    * Semiotic reading: Lines are signs and are relational, just like how letters only come to be words in relation to other letters   &#13;
      * Semiotics as a mode of formal analysis   &#13;
    * Meaning comes from the different parts coming together in the work  &#13;
* Significance: demoiselles uses African elements to produce shock, for their stylistic disjunction; here the eyes are used as a factor of shock &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Guitar and Wineglass 1912*&#13;
&#13;
* Integrating mass culture into the painting  &#13;
* Wallpaper, wood grain, newspaper, sheet music   &#13;
* Wineglass: analytical cubism; pasted into the collage   &#13;
  * Picasso thinking about the style that he developed w Braque as another representational mode of depicting something   &#13;
* Wallpaper is the body of the guitar but also the background  &#13;
* Poggi: contrasts Cubism w Symbolism – focus more on culture, social history   &#13;
  * Symbolists: exist in the industrialized culture but are rejecting in its images  &#13;
    * Interested in pre industrial   &#13;
  * Poggi argues that Picasso challenges the symbolist version of modernism which rejects the products of industrialization   &#13;
* Bois: focus more on the cultural other, form and structure, Picasso’s psychology&#13;
&#13;
Braque *Fruit Dish and Glass*   &#13;
Papier collé&#13;
&#13;
* Significance of mass culture &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Violin* 1912&#13;

* Another example of Papier collé  &#13;
* Newspaper arranged vertically so viewers could read  &#13;
* Wood grain of the surface of the violin as well as the room/ wall exist on the same plane   &#13;
* Curve indicating the bottom of instrument   &#13;
* The f hole in the middle indicates that it’s a violin   &#13;
  * The different sizes of the f holes stand in for the fact that the violin is at an angle &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Au Bon Marché* 1913&#13;
&#13;
* A lot of puns &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Glass of Absinthe* 1914 &#13;
&#13;
* Translate the analytic cubist mode into a sculpture   &#13;
* A collaging sculpture   &#13;

* Return of color; color as material   &#13;
* Patches of both cubism and pointilism &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Harlequin* 1915&#13;
&#13;
* Maintenance of spatial ambiguity   &#13;
* Brown is the background but also a figure   &#13;
* form : Indicates body parts in relation to others  &#13;
* Patches of disjuntion of styles continued &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Three Musicians* 1921&#13;
&#13;
* Collage is informing an entire painted area  &#13;
* Synthesizing existing different planes   &#13;
* Move away from the confrontation w the mass culture   &#13;

#### 1/30 Cubism II: Reception&#13;
&#13;
Picasso: interested in the fundamental question of representation  &#13;
How do you represent something without necessarily repeating its appearance   &#13;
Methods and approaches to Cubism   &#13;
Cubism representing a linguistic model of representation  &#13;
Cubism as a kind of conceptual exercise   &#13;
Importance of Cubism’s influence&#13;

###### *“Primitivism”* &#13;
&#13;
* An aesthetic idealization that emulates the experience of “primitive” forms of life. This “life” is often itself seen as a counterweight to civilization and to modernism  &#13;

&#13;
The “Primitive” and the modern&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Why is this style the most universal and pure (formally and spiritually)?&#13;
&#13;
- Mondrian *Tableau 2* 1922  &#13;
- Van Doesburg *Composition XX* 1920  &#13;
1. There’s no connection to nature, a model that is totally in the ideal realm  &#13;
   an ideal that is invented, divorced from nature but can be derived from nature    &#13;
   Ultimately modeling a utopian theory of life   &#13;
   Paintings as a microcosm of what the world could be   &#13;
   Hopefully this ideal circles back and influences nature → architecture   &#13;
   Paintings are models for the world    &#13;
   1. Interest in Plato   &#13;
      1. The earthly realm   &#13;
      2. The heavenly realm: ideal version of earthly existence  &#13;
2. A drive to find the zero, the essence of painting, self-contained wholes  &#13;
   A non-hierarchical model that influences reality &#13;
&#13;

&#13;
* Orientation to planes and walls → Integration of painting and architecture   &#13;
* Move from looking at the painting as a self-contained whole to be immersed in the painting bc its a pure non-hierarchical model that could affect the thoughts of the person in the space   &#13;
* Walls become planes &#13;
&#13;
*Contra construction project* 1923 &#13;
&#13;
* Wall themselves become planes of colors, a three-dimensional character   &#13;

* Genuine revolutionary energy pre WW2 seems distant   &#13;
* Repeats at style &#13;
&#13;
#### Midterm Concept Review: &#13;
&#13;
**1886-1905 Post-Impressionism**&#13;
&#13;
* reaction against Impressionists' concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and color  &#13;
* sought to bring a more systematic approach to the structure and form of painting  &#13;
* Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne all shared an interest in making art that went beyond the mere representation of the natural world, focusing instead on expressing more abstract, emotional, and spiritual concepts&#13;
&#13;
Synthetism (subset of Post-impressionism)&#13;
&#13;
* Key figure: Paul Gauguin  &#13;
  * Particularly his work in Tahiti: synthesized the outward appearance of the subject matter with the artist's feelings about the subject and the aesthetics of the painting itself (does it also fall under primitivism?)  &#13;
* emphasizes two-dimensional flat patterns, thus rejecting three-dimensional perspective  &#13;
* Characterized by the use of bold flat forms separated by dark contours  &#13;
* Using color symbolically rather than realistically &#13;
&#13;
Neoimpressionism (another subset of post-impressionism)&#13;
&#13;
* response to Impressionism: interested in applying scientific research in optics and color theory to create a more harmonious and structured form of art compared to the more spontaneous and subjective approach of the Impressionists  &#13;
* Key figures: Georges Seurat and Paul Signac  &#13;
* most famous for its development of Pointillism (or Divisionism), a technique involving the application of paint in small dots of pure color, which are intended to blend in the viewer's eye&#13;
&#13;
**1900-1908 Fauvism (transitional stage to Cubism)**&#13;
&#13;
* pure, brilliant colour aggressively applied straight from the paint tubes to create a sense of an explosion on the canvas  &#13;
* Focus on nature (like the Impressionists)   &#13;
* Key figure: Matisse  &#13;
  * reject traditional renderings of three-dimensional space and to seek instead a new picture space defined by movement of colour&#13;
&#13;
**1908-1929 Cubism**&#13;
&#13;
* Key figures: Picasso, Braque   &#13;
* Emphasized flat, two-dimensional surface of the picture plane   &#13;
* rejecting the traditional techniques of perspective, foreshortening, modeling, and chiaroscuro  &#13;
* refuting theories that art should imitate nature&#13;
&#13;
Analytic Cubism (1910-1912)&#13;
&#13;
* While they moved away from naturalistic representation, they are very interested in the idea of representations and different modes of representation   &#13;
* Breaking down, analysis of form, display the essence of an object (or the complex totality of its subject) from multiple perspectives in a single two-dimensional framework  &#13;
* Picasso and Braque: simplified their colour schemes to a nearly monochromatic scale (hues of tan, brown, gray, cream, green, or blue were preferred) in order not to distract the viewer from the artist’s primary interest—the structure of form itself  &#13;
* Semiotics: The relationship between the signifer and the signified   &#13;
* What is the plane doing? move beyond the surface of the canvas rather than to recede in depth  &#13;
* representational motifs: letters, musical instruments, glasses etc. &#13;
&#13;
Synthetic Cubism (Post 1912\) &#13;
&#13;
* emphasize the combination, or synthesis, of forms in the picture  &#13;
* Colour assumes a strong role in these works  &#13;
* Shapes become more decorative   &#13;
* Trompe l’Oeil\!\!  &#13;
  * emphasizes the differences in texture and, at the same time, poses the question of what is reality and what is illusion  &#13;
* Key figures:  Fernand Léger, Sonia Delaunay, Juan Gris, Marcel Duchamp, Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger&#13;
&#13;
Salon Cubism&#13;
&#13;
* Coined to describe the works and the artists of Cubism who exhibited in various Paris Salons  &#13;
* Interested in the geometricizing of form&#13;
&#13;
**1905–1920 Expressionism**&#13;
&#13;
* artist seeks to depict not objective reality but rather the subjective emotions and responses that objects and events arouse within a person  &#13;
* Key artists: Van Gogh, Die Brücke, Ludwig Kirchner  &#13;
* artists used the expressive possibilities of colour and line to explore dramatic and emotion-laden themes, to convey the qualities of fear, horror, and the grotesque, or simply to celebrate nature with hallucinatory intensity&#13;
&#13;
Die Brücke 1905-1913&#13;
&#13;
* played a pivotal role in the development of Expressionism  &#13;
* Emphasized raw, emotional expression through vivid colors and bold strokes  &#13;
* founded by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner  &#13;
* Wanted to defy conventions of traditional painting as well as Impressionism and Post-Impressionism  &#13;
* subject matter—the human figure, landscape, portraiture, still life—executed in a simplified style that stressed bold outlines and strong colour planes&#13;
&#13;
Der Blaue Reiter 1911-1914&#13;
&#13;
* expressionistically oriented  &#13;
* Focused on spiritual and symbolic interpretations of art, with Kandinsky as a leading member  &#13;
* unlike Die Brücke, their expressionism took the form of lyrical abstraction.   &#13;
* imbued their art with deep spiritual content  &#13;
* influenced by the Jugendstil group, Cubism, Futurism, and “**naive**” folk art&#13;

# Basic Definitions&#13;
## Ethnicity&#13;
- a group identity based on a belief in a **common origin**&#13;
- Ethnic groups highlight (supposed) unique cultural aspects to mark inter-group differences and hierarchy&#13;
- Often ethnic identity definition is relative to external “others”&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; _Weber_: That belief is the foundation of identification with an ethnic group, solidarity among group members and definition of common goals.&#13;
&#13;
## Racial Division&#13;
- Social categorization based on **phenotypic** or **biological** criteria&#13;
&#13;
## Nationalism&#13;
- A group’s demand for autonomy in a territory considered to be the group’s homeland &#13;
- usually a demand for a **sovereign state**&#13;
&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
# Ethnic boundaries and culture&#13;
## Social constructivist approach to ethnicity&#13;
- Ethnicity (and race, and nationhood) is a way of viewing the world. It belongs to the real of cognition (its “existence” not ontological but **phenomenological**).&#13;
- Ethnicity (and race, and nationhood) is a **social construct**: it is created and changes through social interactions and symbolic actions.&#13;
- Ethnic boundary making often through **inter-group competition**.&#13;
- Ethnicity has serious implications for people's lives.&#13;
&#13;
## _Jekins_: What is being constructed? &#13;
- Category's boundaries&#13;
- Beliefs about the traits or cultural contents that mark differences between 'us' and them”&#13;
&#13;
## Characteristics of the ethnic boundaries&#13;
- Ethnic boundaries are **fluid**.&#13;
- Ethnic boundaries are sometimes **blurred**.&#13;
- These principles contrast with common sensical view of ethnicity (and race and nation).&#13;
&#13;
## The development of the boundaries approach to ethnicity&#13;
- **Classic cultural anthropology** → Barth → Post Barth&#13;
&gt; Classic cultural anthropology classified ethnic and racial groups based on supposed objective traits.&#13;
&gt; Classification system reflected power relations imperialism and colonialism)&#13;
&#13;
## _Barth_: Ojective definition of ethnic boundries&#13;
- **Relationality**. Ethnic groups are not developed in isolation, but through **interactions** with other groups (key observation: people cross ethnic boundaries!). &#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; Groups are not defined by their culture, which is not an objective unique identifier (there are in-group differences and there are shared traits with out-groups) and changes over time. Ethnicity is a form of **social organization**.&#13;
- What matters is the **subjective demarcation** of boundaries between “us” and “them” by people in the field.&#13;
- Ethnic boundaries limit and prescribe social interactions.&#13;
-  Research should focus on the actions through which ethnic boundaries maintain or change.&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; There are no objective cultural markers of groups. Instead, people on the ground decide which cultural materials matter for their collective identity.&#13;
&#13;
## Post Barth Research&#13;
- Greater emphasis on the fluidity of ethnic boundaries.&#13;
- Interest in the links between symbolic boundaries and social boundaries.&#13;
- Situational ethnicity/ethnicity as cognition&#13;
- Setting the limits to constructivism&#13;
&#13;
## Social Boundary and Symbolic Boundary&#13;
### 1. Social Boundary&#13;
- Social boundaries refer to the tangible and observable divisions that exist in the real world, separating and distinguishing different social groups. &#13;
- These divisions can be based on various factors such as geography, ethnicity, class, religion, or political affiliations. &#13;
- Social boundaries can influence the distribution of resources, power dynamics, and social interactions among individuals and groups. &#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; Social boundaries are **objective** and have a **physical** presence, often manifested in institutional structures and societal norms.&#13;
### 2. Symbolic Boundary&#13;
- Symbolic boundaries are conceptual and constructed through cultural and symbolic representations. &#13;
- They involve the ways in which individuals and groups differentiate themselves and others based on shared meanings, values, and beliefs. &#13;
- Symbolic boundaries are not necessarily tied to physical or spatial separations; instead, they are rooted in the realm of ideas, language, and cultural practices. &#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; Symbolic boundaries are **subjective** and only have an **abstract** presence, they influence perceptions of identity, belonging, and group membership.&#13;
### Relationsips between Social and Symbolic boundaries&#13;
- Symbolic boundaries can **reinforce or challenge** social boundaries&#13;
&gt; Cultural representations and symbolic markers can strengthen group cohesion and reinforce social boundaries, leading to a sense of 'us versus them.' Conversely, symbolic boundaries can also be used to challenge and contest existing social boundaries, contributing to social change and transformation.&#13;
- Social boundaries can **be legitimized** through symbolic boundaries&#13;
&gt; The way a society conceptualizes and represents different social groups, often through media, language, and cultural practices, can legitimize and perpetuate existing social boundaries, either maintaining or reproducing social inequalities.&#13;
- Social boundaries may **influence the formation** of symbolic boundaries&#13;
&gt; The material conditions and power dynamics associated with social boundaries can shape the ways in which groups construct their symbolic boundaries. For example, oppressed or marginalized groups may use symbolic resistance as a means to challenge the dominant social order.&#13;
&#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; What is similar and what is different about the relationships of ethnicity with language and with religion?&#13;
&gt; ### Similar:&#13;
&gt; - Religion sometimes serves as a marker of ethnicity, but the two **do not fully overlap**. &#13;
&gt; - Highlighting religious differences is a political processes _(e.g., to justify claims for material, political, or symbolic resources)_&#13;
&gt; ### Difference:&#13;
&gt; - Sometimes, religion becomes a trans-ethnic or trans-national identity. &#13;
&gt; - Religions provide materials for thick ethnic (or national) identities: idioms, myths, and symbols that add moral and affective load to group membership.&#13;
&gt; - Religious organizations participate in ethnic (or national) identity **construction and socialization**.&#13;
&#13;
## Further viewpoints&#13;
- Culture marks ethnic boundaries, but it also gives content and meaning to **identities** _(“thick identity”)_.&#13;
- This does not mean that we should essentialize ethnic or national culture.&#13;
- Ethnic and national groups are sites of struggles over the meanings attached to **a collective identity** (e.g., different beliefs about the group’s history, its core values, etc., sometimes also about symbolic boundaries).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&#13;
# Boundary Work and Shifts&#13;
## _Nagel_: What caused large-scale ethnic switching? What caused the **fluidity**?&#13;
- Federal policy&#13;
- Ethnic politics&#13;
- Political activism, shared fate, pride, and inspiration&#13;
&#13;
## Characteristics of fluid boundaries:&#13;
- **Cultural differentiation**&#13;
&gt; i.e., identifying certain cultural traits, habits, behaviors, etc. as typical for “us” or for “them”&#13;
- **Social closure**&#13;
&gt; closure and differentiation tend to reinforce each other&#13;
- **Political salience**&#13;
&gt; “thick” identities reduce the range of possible political actions; ethnic politics tends to reinforce differentiation and closure&#13;
&#13;
## Boundary work&#13;
- The phenomenon of individuals or groups **creating, maintaining, adjusting, or breaking through** various boundaries in society, such as ethnic, cultural, social, etc., **to shape identity, group relationships, and social interactions**.&#13;
- Ethnic categories may **expand or contract** (a focal topic in ethnic studies) due to boundary work.&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; _Wimmer_: People have repertoires of identities to chose from. Their choices may change when institutional incentives change. So, **repertories ≠ situational ethnicity**.&#13;
&#13;
## Components of Boundary Work&#13;
- **Type of boundary**&#13;
&gt; which criteria for similarity/difference (e.g., ethnicity, race, gender, nationality, generation) is highlighted in the pursue or recognition and/or political power?&#13;
- **Type of strategy**&#13;
&gt; e.g., boundary crossing; normative inversion; expansion; contraction&#13;
- **Location of boundary**&#13;
&gt; membership rule: what is the criterion or threshold for being one of “us”?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&#13;
# Pan-ethnicity, situational ethnicity, the limit of constructivism&#13;
## Situational Ethnicity&#13;
-  Individuals or groups actively choosing to emphasize or express a specific ethnic identity in a particular context. &#13;
- This identity is determined by the current social environment, social situations, or specific contexts, and may change due to different situations.&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; Individuals or groups selectively emphasize or conceal their ethnic identity based on different social contexts to **adapt to different social needs or express a sense of belonging**. &#13;
&#13;
## Impacts of (activated) ethnic identification (self or other) on social interactions&#13;
-  Cognitive schemes of interpretation (_Brubaker：Ethnicity as Cognition_)&#13;
- Affective dispositions (sometimes _hot cognition_)&#13;
- Behavioral tendencies&#13;
- But interactions can also generate shifts in the above _(e.g., contact theory)_&#13;
&#13;
## Two types of variation in ethnic identification&#13;
- **Temporal** (i.e., the conditions that evoke different degrees and expressions of ethnic identification).&#13;
&gt; e.g., In certain specific social events or cultural celebrations, individuals may express their ethnic identity more strongly, while in other everyday contexts, ethnic identity may be relatively weak or less prominent.&#13;
- **Cross-sectional**: hierarchies of identities (i.e., identities’ relative degree of salience).&#13;
&gt; e.g., A person may emphasize their professional identity more in the workplace, while emphasizing their ethnic identity more at family gatherings.&#13;
&#13;
## Instrumental ethnicity&#13;
- Sometimes ethnicity is used instrumentally, but that is because it has been **internalized** and is considered **primordial**. &#13;
- Also, there is a difference between superficial act of signaling and deep act of adopting/embracing an identity.&#13;
- The content of ethnic identity functions as a **filter** through which personal and collective goals are defined and sorted.&#13;
&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
# Managing ethnic diversity&#13;
## What is a nation?&#13;
### Defition: &#13;
_Anderson (Imagined Communities, p.6):_ An imagined political community-and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign. &#13;
### What composes this definition?&#13;
- **Imagined**&#13;
&gt; Even in the smallest of all nations, a member will **never** know, meet, or event hear about most other members. However, the shared nation 'exists' in the consciousness of its members.&#13;
- **Limited**&#13;
&gt; People imagined nations as **bounded**: in our minds, the world population is divided to distinct nations. Perceived criteria for national membership. There are Rules for how to join 'our' nation.&#13;
- **Sovereign**&#13;
&gt; The nation is perceived by its members and outsiders who recognize its existence as sovereign or at least entitled to sovereignty. That makes the nation a **political community**: nations should **run their own business based on shared goals**.&#13;
- **Community**&#13;
&gt; The nation as an extended family or fraternity: a group whose members **share an equality at a profound level**. A community of feelings, solidarity, loyalty, and sometimes sacrifice (of people who are mostly **anonymous** to each other and also **unequal** in many respects).&#13;
&#13;
## How are (some) of the components may be related to ethnicity and interethnic relations?&#13;
- Nationhood (_sovereign_) and Nation-ness (_internal unity and cohesion_)&#13;
- A community of feelings and shared fate via the cultural stuff&#13;
- Ethnic mythology and symbols in the service of nationalism&#13;
- Myths of origin and antiquity&#13;
- A scared land via 'poetic spaces' _(e.g., archeological sites, battle fields, monuments, national map)._&#13;
- Golden age, national heroes. &#13;
- The collective past as a moral yardstick for evaluating the present and blueprint for the future via collective goals _(i.e., national revival)._&#13;
&#13;
## What is nation-state?&#13;
- A **territorially bounded sovereign** polity-ie., a state - that is **ruled in the name of a community** of citizens who **identify themselves as a nation**.&#13;
- A fusion of two principles: **state** sovereignty and **national** sovereignty.&#13;
- Nation-state institutions nurture **national sentiments**.&#13;
&gt; For members of the nation, 'their' state (which they usually see as their homeland) is the object of love, commitment or yearning.&#13;
&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; This definition highlights that **the authority of governments** of nation-state is based on the **claim-made inwards** (i.e., the people) and **outwards** (i.e., the international community)-that the government rules in the name of a nation.&#13;
&#13;
## Solutions to the problem of incongruence of cultural and political boundaries&#13;
### Reducing / eliminating diversity：&#13;
- Oppression (by authoritarian regimes)&#13;
- Ethnic cleansing&#13;
﻿- Assimilation policies through centralized education and cultural institutions&#13;
### Managing diversity: &#13;
- Political arrangements that contain ethnic diversity and reduce conflict&#13;
&#13;
## Typology of Democracies&#13;
- Republican liberal&#13;
- Individual liberal&#13;
- Consociational&#13;
- Multicultural&#13;
- ﻿﻿Ethnic democracy&#13;
&#13;
## Some of the challenges to inclusionary management of diversity&#13;
- **Large migrations** &#13;
&gt; less assimilation + postnational incorporation (_Soysal_); resistance by host societies&#13;
- **Indigenous Movements** &#13;
&gt; request greater respect and protection for their culture and rights&#13;
- The rise of **neo-nationalism** &#13;
&gt; resulting in exclusion of multiculturalism, and even triggering discrimination and hostility towards specific ethnic or cultural groups&#13;
- Empowerment of **populist-authoritarian leaders**&#13;
&gt; tend to emphasize nationalism and xenophobia, and hold a hostile attitude towards ethnic minorities and immigrants&#13;
&#13;
## What is 'postliberal' politics / citizenship?&#13;
- Demanding **recognition** in cultural uniqueness of ethnic minority _(resistance to complete assimilation)_.&#13;
- Claiming **collective rights** for ethnic groups _(in addition to equal/just distribution of resources)_.&#13;
- Demanding **autonomy** within the state for ethnic groups in their traditional territories.&#13;
- Demanding maintenance and extension of **civil rights**.&#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; Citizenship allows **contradictions** between autonomy and civil rights _(e.g., patriarchal norms)_&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
# Ethic stratification and inequality&#13;
## What is a **Social Stratification**?&#13;
- **Institutionalized** inequality (including legitimizing ideology)&#13;
- Inequality between **social categories**&#13;
- Inequality in access to different types of **resources** _(e.g., economic, political, legal, health, etc.)_&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt;Ethnic stratification: A state of at least **partial alignment** of ethnic division and social stratification.&#13;
&#13;
## How does status translate into economic advantages?&#13;
- Ethnic division of **labor** (monopoly over certain occupations)&#13;
- **Endogamy** (marriage as an economic exchange)&#13;
- **Stereotypes** (affect the judgment of employment, landlords, policemen, judges, etc.)&#13;
- **Ideology** may justify alignment of status and class&#13;
&#13;
## Ethnic stratification via **Political Arrangements**&#13;
- Ethnic stratification in **colonial and postcolonial** states&#13;
- **Global stratification** (_citizenship as a resource_)&#13;
&gt; There is an unequal distribution of opportunities, privileges, and resources among individuals and groups in different countries or regions. &#13;
&#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; In this context, citizenship is seen as a valuable resource that **grants individuals specific rights, protections, and benefits** based on their country of origin or nationality.&#13;
&#13;
- **Group discrimination** by state institutions&#13;
- Differential access to certain **jobs**&#13;
- Mechanisms of inclusion/exclusion of **immigrants** based on their ethnicities&#13;

# Assimilation/Integration/Segregation/Incorporation of Immigrant Ethnic minorities&#13;
## _Portes and Zhou_: Three types of **Acculturation Approach**:&#13;
- **Adoption** of the dominant culture and assimilation in the **middle-class**.&#13;
- **Adoption** of a counter-culture and assimilation in **lower classes**.&#13;
- Social and economic **mobility** through maintenance of an ethnic group's culture, values, and solidarity.&#13;
&#13;
## The Impact of the Context in the Receiving Country and Society&#13;
- Government policy: receptive, indifferent, or hostile&#13;
- Societal reception: Prejudiced or nonprejudiced&#13;
- Co-ethnic community: Weak or strong&#13;
&#13;
## What drives certain groups to 'choose' differentiation/assimilation?&#13;
- Skin color&#13;
- Place of residence&#13;
- Economic shifts&#13;
- Capacity to utilize them though different types of capital&#13;
&#13;
## The long-term effects of the 'context'&#13;
- **Government's assistance** to immigrants improves their children's (and their children's) mobility chances.&#13;
- Sometime **negative stereotypes** persist for generations.&#13;
- Immigrant's decision to join strong ethnic community may affect the **mobility of their offspring**.&#13;

# Ethnic Violence&#13;
## Types of ethnic violence&#13;
-  Ethnic riot &#13;
- Lynch  &#13;
- Pogrom &#13;
- Ethnocide _(of culture)_&#13;
- Genocide (of people)&#13;
- Inter-state wars may include an ethnic component&#13;
- Civil wars&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; Some ethnic conflicts include **more than one** type of violence.&#13;
&#13;
## Previous reasons for collective violence：&#13;
- Violence is **natural**; a human tendency that had developed through evolution.&#13;
- **Socialization** to violence&#13;
&gt; (a) arguments about **failed socialization**; (b) arguments about socialization to **non-normative behavior**.&#13;
- **Psychoanalytical** argument&#13;
&gt; e.g., (a) violence as **externalization of interna tensions**; (b) violence as projection of suppressed traumatic social relationships (for instance, _child-parents or child-teacher_).&#13;
- **Crowd** psychology&#13;
&gt; people become violent during collective action that causes **de-individuation and extasy**&#13;
&#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; Classic arguments are partial explanation that point to possible roots of **people’s motivation** to participate in ethnic violence, but they **cannot explain instances** of ethnic violence.&#13;
&#13;
## _Ted Robert Gurr_: Reasons for ethnic violence&#13;
- The basis of violence is frustration (frustration-aggression theory).&#13;
- Frustration stems from relative deprivation (not necessarily economic).&#13;
- An ethnic group’s leadership utilizes feelings of frustration and anger to mobilize them for protest and violence. Sometimes this is done as a cold-minded strategy.&#13;
&#13;
## Characteristics of Ethnic Riot&#13;
- Brutal&#13;
- Highly passionate, but with clear patterns &#13;
&gt; e.g., target selection, common order: trigger event, rumors spread, escalation, (expansion to other places), decline.&#13;
- Violence as meaning for **participants**&#13;
- Violence has **general and immediate causes** &#13;
&gt; distal/proximate causes&#13;
&gt; Violence reflects ethnic/racial **cleavages**, but it is not a necessary outcome of the cleavages&#13;
- A process with internal dynamic&#13;
- **Trigger** events often have special **symbolic meanings**&#13;
- **Leaders** may provoke feelings of frustration, rage, hatred, and fear&#13;
&gt; including by employing elements of **collective memory**&#13;
- **Rumors** are a key mechanism of mass mobilization for active or passive support.&#13;
- **Aggressive reaction** by the rival validate negative feelings and sense of righteousness, thus propagate violence&#13;
- Violence converts negative feelings to **positive feelings**&#13;
&gt; solidarity, pride, hope, even euphoria _(Tambiah: Jubilant Destruction)_&#13;
&#13;
## _Wimmer_: The Political Context of Violent Ethnic Conflicts&#13;
- Statistical association between ethnic violence and **political competition and exclusion**&#13;
&gt; – Ethnic uprising is more common in **ethnocracies**.&#13;
&gt; – Ethnic violence (especially coup attempts) is more common when ruling is divided between the **elites** of several ethnic groups.&#13;
&gt; – Ethnic uprising and coup attempts are more common in countries where an **ethnic minority has a history of controlling** part or the entire territory. &#13;
- Ethnic violence during the **collapse** of a polity &#13;
&gt; e.g., the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia. Mechanisms: political opportunity, contagion, security dilemma.&#13;
- Violence during or after **elections** &#13;
&gt; e.g., Kenya 2007-8 following rumors that the elections were stolen from the Kikuyu.&#13;
- Cities with **intense political competition** experience more ethnic violence&#13;
&#13;
## How people choose attitudes towards violence?&#13;
- **Rational choice**: Expected benefits/risks&#13;
&gt; Mechanisms: Social control, policing&#13;
&#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; It is possible that rational choice is more typical of specific phases of conflicts (e.g., after escalation or when it gets clearer who is going to win)&#13;
&#13;
- **Symbolic politics**: Participation in violence is emotional and sentimental (especially hatred and rage toward the enemy).&#13;
&gt; Mechanisms: &#13;
&gt; - People’s tendency to protect their group from symbolic threats or existential threats&#13;
&gt; - Elite’s manipulative use of ethnic myths and symbols to provoke hatred, rage, and fear of the enemy + internal solidarity and excitement &#13;
&gt; - Symbolic politics flattens identities, creates “collective mind”: identity dichotomy (us/them), stereotypical thinking (good/evil) &#13;
&gt; - Affective reactions: positive feelings about the home group and negative feelings about the enemy&#13;
&gt; - A spiral of revenge and escalation &#13;
- **Institutionalized violence**: Routinization and ritualization of violence&#13;
&gt; Circumstances and Mechanisms: &#13;
&gt; - Non-violent ethnic protests deteriorates to violence&#13;
&gt; - Actors that keep the ethnic conflicts “burning” (some of them provoke violence during crises : politicians, religious leaders, mural painters, gangs, local media&#13;
&gt; - Many ordinary people have experience, or at least memories from past episodes of violence: they “know” what their role is likely to be; they remember the solidarity and elation they felt; they may wait for an opportunity for revenge&#13;
&gt; - Therefore, the violence process looks like a ritual with clear roles and a predicted pattern of development&#13;
&gt; - In some cities, violence is expected, almost trivial&#13;
&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; The three attitudes are **not mutually exclusive** and may appear as one or multiple simultaneously。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://Yuezi-1223.github.io/yuezi.github.io/post/Study%20Note%20-%20Ethnic%20Divisions%20and%20Segregation%2C%20Harvard%202023.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 13:31:19 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
