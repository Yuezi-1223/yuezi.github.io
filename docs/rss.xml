&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; By comparing **parallel texts of English translations of the same event - The death of Patroclus**, it can be seen that there are aesthetic differences between individualism and tragedy in Homeric and Virgilian Epic. It discusses the Virgilian paradox, an epic of drama and pathos that goes back to the origins of modern debate on Virgil in the Romantic period, where the supposed **natural primitivism and fresh naivete of Homer** was commonly and unfavourably contrasted with the **more artificial and sophisticated Virgilian epic**. &#13;
&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&gt; It argues that Virgil too sensed from the beginning that the naturalness and noble simplicity of Homer was essentially irrecoverable in the cultural context of the first century BC, but that he had the opportunity to create a Homer for his own times. It also charts the quintessential ambiguity of the Aeneid, both reflecting the **traditionally nationalistic ideology of Roman epic in the steps of Naevius and Ennius**, and **showing an extraordinary empathy with the focalisations and feelings of individual characters**, many of whom represent a point of view at odds with the direction of the nationalistic plot.&#13;

## The death of Patroclus: Homer, _Iliad_ 16.751–867&#13;
&gt; From ancient Greek into English &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IL.16.751   He spoke so, and strode against the [hero](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3383) Kebriones&#13;
[IL.16.752](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16752)   with the [spring](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=5082) of a [lion](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3780), who as he ravages the [pastures](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=4259)&#13;
[IL.16.753](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16753)   has been hit in the [chest](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=2060), and [his own](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=1063) [courage](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=2256) destroys him.&#13;
IL.16.754   So in your [fury](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3048) you pounced, Patroklos, above Kebriones.&#13;
[IL.16.755](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16755)   On the other [side](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=4896) Hektor sprang to the [ground](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3208) from his [chariot](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=2044),&#13;
[IL.16.756](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16756)   and the two fought it out over Kebriones, like [lions](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3783)&#13;
[IL.16.757](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16757)   who in the [high places](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=1060) of a [mountain](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=4036), both in [huge](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3493) [courage](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=2256)&#13;

[IL.16.762](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16762)   since Hektor had caught him by the [head](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=3309), and would not let go of him,&#13;
[IL.16.763](http://panini.northwestern.edu/AnaServer?eumaios+0+eumaios.anv+eumaiosid=I16763)   and Patroklos had his [foot](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=2960) on the other [side](http://homer.library.northwestern.edu/html/enggrk.cgi?id=4896), while the other&#13;

&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&#13;
## The death of Pallas: Virgil, _Aeneid_ 10.439–509&#13;
&gt; From Latin into English&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile the kind nymph sent her brother Turnus &#13;
To Lausus’ aid. He sped his chariot 				&#13;
Through the line and told his comrades, “Now stand down. &#13;
Pallas belongs to me. I’ll go for him. &#13;
I only wish his father could look on.” &#13;
He spoke. His comrades quit the field as ordered. &#13;
With the Rutulians gone, the youth, transfixed 		&#13;
By the haughty orders, let his hard gaze rove &#13;
From a distance over Turnus’ massive form. &#13;
He gave this answer to the tyrant’s words: &#13;
“Either’s a glorious prize: a general’s armor &#13;
Or death. It makes no difference to my father. 		&#13;
So stop your threats.” He stepped into the open, &#13;
Freezing the blood in the Arcadians’ hearts. &#13;
Turnus jumped down and closed in on his prey &#13;
On foot. A lion on his lofty post &#13;
Sees a bull lunging on a distant plain 		     	                                            &#13;
And hurtles toward him: Turnus looked like this. &#13;
Pallas first gauged his spear’s range, then stepped forward, &#13;
Calling on the huge sky in hope that chance &#13;
Would bless his bravery against the odds. &#13;
“Hercules, come—my father took you in, 			                                    &#13;
A stranger—help in this great enterprise. &#13;
Let dying Turnus see his bloody weapons &#13;
Taken from him by my victorious hands.” &#13;
The god heard, but he stifled heavy groans &#13;
In his heart; the tears were futile that he shed. 		                                   &#13;
To comfort him, his father, Jupiter, &#13;
Said this: “An end is set for everyone, &#13;
For life is brief and cannot be recovered. &#13;
But brave men, through their exploits, strive for fame &#13;
That lasts. Beneath Troy’s high walls many sons 		                                   &#13;
Of gods died. My own child Sarpedon died there.&#13;
Fate calls: for Turnus too the race is ending.” &#13;
He turned his eyes away from Italy’s fields. &#13;
Pallas with all his great strength cast his spear &#13;
And snatched his bright sword from the hollow sheath. 	                           &#13;
The spear flew, pierced the layers of the shield, &#13;
And struck the breastplate at the shoulder’s rim, &#13;
Finally grazing Turnus’ massive form. &#13;
But he in turn deliberately aimed &#13;
His iron-pointed pike and launched it, saying, 		                                   &#13;
“See if my weapon is the one to stick.&#13;
The spearhead, striking, shaking, pounded through &#13;
The shield—all of the bronze and iron sheets, &#13;
All of the bull-hide layers wrapping it— &#13;
Into the breastplate, into that strong chest. 			                                   &#13;
Out of the wound he tore the heated shaft, &#13;
But with it came his lifeblood and his soul. &#13;
Collapsing forward with a crash of arms, &#13;
He touched the enemy earth with gory lips. &#13;
Turnus stood over him: 					                                                  &#13;
“Go tell Evander this, Arcadians: &#13;
I send him back the Pallas he deserves. &#13;
The soothing tribute of a burial I grant him. &#13;
But he had a costly guest— Aeneas.” &#13;
With his foot he held the corpse down 			                                          &#13;
And stripped the giant swordbelt with its story  &#13;
Of crime etched in—a wedding night that left &#13;
The bedrooms smeared with gore of slaughtered youths— &#13;
That Clonus, son of Eurytus, had embossed &#13;
In gold, and Turnus now was thrilled to loot. 			                         &#13;
People know nothing of their fated future. &#13;
Their exaltation cannot stay in bounds. &#13;
The time would come when he’d give anything &#13;
Not to have touched the boy. He’d hate his plunder, &#13;
And hate this day. Pallas’ friends pressed in, wailing. 	                                 &#13;
They laid him on his shield to haul away.&#13;
What grief, what glory you will take your father! &#13;
A single day brought war and death to you. &#13;
But see the heaps of enemy dead you leave.&#13;
&#13;

The most relevant piece for our session is Ch. 1 of [Barchiesi 2015](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvkc7) (on JSTOR) ‘THE DEATH OF PALLAS. Intertextuality and Transformation of the Epic Model&#13;
(pp. 1-34)’. This will be particularly relevant to the primary text case study which we shall discuss.

Abstract: In this study I shall try to indicate how Vergil has in fact incorporated the whole Iliad and the whole Odyssey into the Aeneid, incomparably transforming the Homeric epics. I must start with a few methodological considerations. I shall then seek to explain the relation of some of the most important passages of the Aeneid to their Homeric counterparts. Finally I shall try to suggest how we ought to understand this grand poetical contest.&#13;

#### 2/27 Dada&#13;
&#13;
Context: WW1: Culmination of enlightenment rationality itself   &#13;
Assassination → series of European countries declaring war on each other bc of interlocking alliances   &#13;
Dada: a critique of the war (politically motivated) / critique of the rationality of the war itself &#13;
&#13;

&#13;
* Where artists flee  &#13;
* Dada born out of WW1  &#13;

* Post-war artists dispersed to   &#13;
  * Berlin   &#13;
  * Hanover  &#13;
  * Cologne  &#13;

  * Paris: pivoted to surrealism &#13;
&#13;
###### *Zurich Dada*&#13;
&#13;
Janco *Cabaret Voltaire* 1919&#13;
&#13;
* Harassing of the audience, collective playfulness  &#13;
* Emphasis on mysticism: anti-rational mode   &#13;
* (A different strand of primitivism)&#13;
&#13;
The Dada Manifesto &#13;
&#13;
* A challenge of meaning itself   &#13;
* Linguistic irrationality   &#13;
* “To be a Dadaist is perhaps to be more of a businessman, more of a politician than an artist – or to be an artist only by accident to be a Dadaist is to be turned and tossed by events, to resist petrifaction”  &#13;
* The meaning of being an artist is defined by constant innovation and disruption &#13;
&#13;
Dancing w a mask by Marcel Janco 1916-1917&#13;

* Different from the constructivism mode: bourgeois aesthetic judgement → composition  &#13;
* Whereas Dada: the arbitrary/ absence of logic → composition   &#13;
* Noncompositionality &#13;
&#13;
Taeuber-Arp \&amp;Hans Arp *Duo Collage* 1918&#13;
&#13;
* Move away from the gestural trace from the work above; eliminated the traces of the artists hand and we don’t know whose hand is it bc there are two artists   &#13;

  * Refers to the existence of a magazine or a newspaper  &#13;
  * No one coherent figure, parts of machines, scenes of the metropolis, text, german military leaders and political leaders  &#13;

* Even w a disorienting scale, it has a sense of sameness  &#13;
* Manipulation of an image that has a seamless appearance   &#13;
* Anti capitalist critique of Hitler  &#13;
  * Indicating hitler as a standin of big capitalism    &#13;
* Made right before Hitler becomes Chancelor&#13;
&#13;
The Dada Economy &#13;

&#13;
Hugo Ball  &#13;
Believed that the art market sold out and that they were no different from other market participants   &#13;
Hyperinflation &#13;
&#13;
How does Dada reflect capitalism rather than oppose it?  &#13;
Dada's anti-moralism began to directly reflect capitalist nihilism. Capitalist nihilism, however, is the valorisation process of capital value swallowing, progressively, all (cultural, normative, moral) values that are not capitalist yet. The avant-gardes' 'brave' move against morals, in this sense, was as “untimely” as Nietzsche's same move a few decades earlier. The only thing left to do after this delving into cynicism was to follow a cosmologically conceived naïve anarchism for which the end of self-determination equals the end of domination, since subjectivity is nothing but a disciplining function, and conscience nothing but a fatherly super-ego. Of course, such 'anarchism' must pretend that no societal infrastructure would be left after one withdrew from one's conscious, conscientious, responsive autonomy – as if desire or fantasy were somehow 'outside' of (consumerist\!) society. Without a doubt, today's art world is dominated by this cynical version of “anarchism”, and its hegemony mimics capital's valorising devalorisation – or capitalist nihilism.&#13;

#### 3/5 Marcel Duchamp&#13;
&#13;
* Relate to Dada \+ salon cubism&#13;
&#13;
*Nude Descending a Staircase no.2* 1912   &#13;
*The Passage from Virgin to Bride* 1912  &#13;

“based on a reaction of visual indifference, with at the same time a total absence of good or bad taste….”&#13;
&#13;
Readymades &#13;
&#13;
* Everyday, mass-produced    &#13;
* Abt painting  &#13;
* The art is not the intuitive decorative expression but it’s THE idea  &#13;
* Conceptualism   &#13;
* Using pictures to engage w text – a linguistic dimension   &#13;
* Using text to re signify objects as artworks   &#13;
* Paintings have lost their historical significance and have already become on one hand conceptual and on another, mechanical execution   &#13;
* The comb 1916: punning of comb in french/ painting in french  &#13;
  * Kant: aesthetic judgment   &#13;
* After Duchamp, the question is not is this good art; the Q is is it art in the first place (good and bad doesn't matter)  &#13;
* Duchamp is only an okay painter so he’s finding the third option by turning the whole thing on its head  &#13;
* Dadaist engagement w chance, filtered through readymades &#13;
&#13;
Fountain 1917 &#13;

 #### 1/16 Post-Impressionism&#13;
&#13;
**Impressionism**  &#13;
developed in France in the 19C. century and is based on the practice of painting out of doors and spontaneously 'on the spot' rather than in a studio from sketches&#13;
&#13;
* Produced an unfinished look in paintings  &#13;
* Reflected fleeting moments  &#13;
* Painted scenes that looked fuzzy and unrefined  &#13;
* Used short, quick brush strokes  &#13;
* Key artists: Monet, Degas, Pissarro   &#13;
  * Monet: uses **natural pastel hue**   &#13;
* Motivation: create the impression of a moment (idea comes from realism), focuses on lighting  &#13;
&#13;
**Post Impressionism** &#13;
&#13;
* Artists move further away from academic naturalism (towards abstraction)  &#13;
* Strong influence non-European art and culture (Japanese prints, Primitivism)  &#13;
* Key Artists: Gauguin, Van Gogh  &#13;
  * Expressive color  &#13;
  * Painting as subjective expression: how art can evoke emotions   &#13;
  * Painting as escape from anxieties of modern life  &#13;
* Cezanne, Seurat  &#13;
  * Geometric stability  &#13;
  * Attention to form and structure  &#13;
  * Seurat: manipulates color, develops pointillism &#13;
&#13;
Gauguin, *Vision after the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel)*, 1888&#13;
&#13;
* Post impressionism   &#13;
* Color: white and red/ impasto red dramatic   &#13;

#### 1/18 Modernism &amp; The female Nude: Picasso's Les demoiselles d' Avigonon&#13;
&#13;
**Context:**   &#13;
1907  &#13;
How the painting represents the relationship between the female nude and modernism  &#13;
History of western art and the Renaissance   &#13;
Immediate context in which Picasso made this painting   &#13;
General reception of the painting &#13;
&#13;
Picasso:&#13;
&#13;
- Known as the inventor of cubism   &#13;
- Known for Guernica (anti-war painting in 1937\)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
- Picasso skilled at naturalism, creating an image that looks lifelike   &#13;
- An opportunity to think about abstraction   &#13;
- Abstraction is about deconstruction of representation   &#13;
- A result of specific set of choices &#13;
&#13;
Within the western tradition, long history of images/ sculpture of nude figures   &#13;
At the center of Greek art was the male nude (Michelangelo’s David; Antonio’s Perseus)&#13;
&#13;
- Male figure \- heroic   &#13;
- The accurate depiction of male nude \- highest level of artist achievement &#13;
&#13;
In contrast, female nude:&#13;
&#13;
- Nude image of female had an erotic function   &#13;
- William Hogarth, Marriagea la Mode: curtain drawn over a female nude bc it’s so overly erotic   &#13;
- Titles like: sleeping venus; Rokeby Venus; the Toilette of Venus (god of love) \-\&gt; a mythological pretext for her nudity  &#13;
- Distort female body to show more nudity  &#13;
- Emerged in the context of italian renaissance that insisted upon the gap of the functions of male and female nudity &#13;
&#13;
Edouard Manuet \- broke the historical tradition &#13;
&#13;
- Olympia, 1863 (referencing Venus of Urbino) \- first modernist painting   &#13;
  - Depicts the modern life  &#13;
  - Declares the surface of painting, acknowledges the existence of the canvas   &#13;
  - Frankness of her stare suggests a transactional relationship btw viewers of the painting and her  &#13;
  - Flowers brought to her by a woman who’s her servant (African descent) from her next client   &#13;
- A hinge btw the history of reclining female nude and its modern iteration  &#13;
- Deliberately updates the figure, no longer a mythological figure of Venus but explicitly a modern sex worker   &#13;
- The way in which he compressed the space (compared to Venus of Urbino) \- darkness → shallow background, brightness of white presses forward   &#13;
  - Establishes a precedent of avant garde shock that happens through the female nude&#13;
&#13;
Paul Gauguin, Copy of Manuet’s Olympia 1891&#13;
&#13;
- A deliberate conversation   &#13;
- Modernism is worked through the body of female nude  &#13;
    &#13;
  Sex workers/ women, an emblem of modernism “The New Woman”  &#13;
- The beautiful girl 1919  &#13;
- Street, berlin, 1913&#13;
&#13;
Paul Cezanne, The large bathers, 1906&#13;
&#13;
- He challenges the fundamental assumptions of naturalism  &#13;
- Ex: this work depicts the real world but also presents itself as a painting through  &#13;
  - The breaking open of form (the distortion of tree branches; the relationship between the trunk and the sky)&#13;
&#13;
Matisse paints Bonheur de vive (in conversation w the painting above)&#13;
&#13;
- Abstraction  &#13;
- Emptying out of form  &#13;
- Emphasis on outline  &#13;
- Discrete scenes: idealized and pastoral   &#13;
- Trying to create a modern, classical grandeur   &#13;
- Pleasing to look at&#13;
&#13;
Gertrude Stein: hangs up this painting, seen by Picasso   &#13;
Picasso was in the process of painting the portrait of Gertrude Stein, saw Matisse’s painting as a challenge and came up w Les Demoiselles d Avignon  &#13;
&#13;
- The painting of Gertrude Stein reflects his interest in form&#13;
&#13;
**Les Demoiselles d Avignon** (Symbolic of Picasso’s misogyny and racism)  &#13;
No pastoral setting, no bright colors  &#13;
everything is angular    &#13;
Red light district in Barcelona (Spanish sex workers)  &#13;
Shallow space → compression achieved through a lack of background detail; a tangled of bodies; disproportion of faces  &#13;
stylistic dysjunction (multiple styles happening in one painting)&#13;
&#13;
- Faces resemble → Dan mask; Baule mask → signifies Africaness/ a monstrosity&#13;
&#13;
Flatness of figures   &#13;
Presence of a reclining figure (second on the left)&#13;
&#13;
- Makes more sense if she were to be lying down  &#13;
- Rendering her hinged up at the viewers  &#13;
- Further compresses the space, a furthering of abstraction  &#13;
- What does that achieve?   &#13;
  - The figure becomes confrontational   &#13;
  - Gazes are multiplied (compared to Olympia), extending the dialogue  &#13;
  - Olympia confronts the everyday male viewer w his own practices of sexuality and how that’s comodified   &#13;
  - Whereas Picasso is aiming to further the shock factor, to further highlight to the male viewers the banality of the everyday life; updates a classic genre, intentionally   &#13;
    - Through the extension of flattening, the multiplication of gazes  &#13;
- Figure on the very left  &#13;
  - Holding open a curtain for viewers to survey her body&#13;
&#13;
Nowhere for the eyes to go, attention gets thrown back to the foreground  &#13;
(white and black are used to render volume, which the painting lacks)  &#13;
The fruit at the bottom of the canvas &#13;
&#13;
- Putting viewers at the table, engaging with and confronting the women directly&#13;
&#13;
Understood as a formal innovation that led to Cubism &#13;
&#13;
Primitivism in 20th C.: Western writers conceive the cultural other as an authenticity, as a sight of other than themselves, rather than reflecting about the differences &#13;
&#13;
Ringgold, Picasso’s Studio&#13;
&#13;
- Picasso becomes a side character in the story of modernism &#13;
&#13;
#### 1/23 Post-Impressionism (Continue)&#13;
&#13;
Divisionism: reflecting on the division of plane into infinite dots  &#13;
Pointillism &#13;
&#13;
- Two directions that artists go to engage w colors (differentiation vs synthesis) &#13;
&#13;
###### *Georges Seurat*&#13;
&#13;
Interested in scientific approach to color, to bringing stability and classical quality to impressionism   &#13;
And thinking about class in the contemporary context&#13;
&#13;
* Bathers at Asnieres 1884  &#13;
  * Working class leisure   &#13;
  * Lower class status  &#13;
  * Context: Pastoral, mythological settings of traditional bather paintings   &#13;
* Sunday Afternoon 1884  &#13;
  * Middle class leisure   &#13;
  * Mature style → more dotted    &#13;
* Le chahut 1889  &#13;
  * Performance as a social context, not an image of performance isolated from its context Create opportunities for a rich patterning of colors → stability of subject, contradicts the content  &#13;
  * Stability vs. movement (classism, solemnity)  &#13;
* Parade de cirque 1887  &#13;
  * Bourgeois, leisure, at night &#13;
&#13;
![微信截图_20240906113348](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2824175-d518-4b8f-a4d6-aa94b722a4a3)&#13;
&#13;
Influential figure for the development of cubism, not totally post impressionist bc approach looks very different from impressionist   &#13;
Breaking open closed form&#13;
&#13;
* Still Life w Basket of apples 1893  &#13;
  * Stuffy genre → still life   &#13;
  * Creating a scene w multiple diff perspectives   &#13;
  * Edge of table doesn’t line up, the corners don’t match  &#13;
  * Thick application of paint for napkin: Creating a sense of structure, of folds  &#13;
  * Overall composition: disorienting   &#13;
    * Trying to paint in a way that reflect the way our eyes engage w paintings → not linear, not single point perspective; our eyes wander around   &#13;
    * Breaking the standard criteria of composition since Renaissance which is the idea of a unified image (→ painting has to present one thing from one view) \- Deconstruction of tradition   &#13;
    * Representation vs reality: how painting constructs representation   &#13;
    * Interested in the materiality of color; Brush strokes: constructing forms w paint   &#13;
* Mont sainte Victoire 1885  &#13;
  * Disintegration of form   &#13;
  * Lack of outline: truck of tree vs un outlined zone next to it  &#13;
  * Recession of space, tree established a sense of distance   &#13;
* Mont Sainte Victoire 1902  &#13;
  * Repeated patches of color \- pixelated \- sit on the surface of the canvas   &#13;
  * Stacked up vertically, no sense of space   &#13;
  * Bleeding of forms \- breaking open of form itself; form isn’t a coherent thing, designated by outlines or not; Key principle that Cezanne is challenging   &#13;
  * Analysis of representation through the materiality of painting   &#13;
* The Large Bathers 1906  &#13;
* Bathers 1894-1905  &#13;
  * Drawing on a tradition of scenes of bathers   &#13;
    * idealized natural setting, mythological context (Diana and Callisto 1635; Pastoral Symphony 1510\)  &#13;
    * Bathing: pretext for nudity   &#13;
  * Cezanne and Seurat continue the tradition  &#13;
    * Interest in using new techniques to engage traditional subjects &#13;
&#13;
Impressionists: Momentarily experience w naturalism   &#13;
Post impressionist: artist capture their own experience in a subjective way &#13;
&#13;
- Everyone is motivated by the desire to access truth, to make a painting that feels true and real, whether its through personal temperament or objective perspective   &#13;
- Idea of Expressionism is emerging &#13;
&#13;

* Color creating a rich dense surface &#13;
&#13;

&#13;
The Red Studio 1911&#13;
&#13;
* Tradition of artists painting about their studio  &#13;
* Defeat our eyes desire to read depth   &#13;
  * Red flattens the space (like Vision after the Sermon by Gauguin)  &#13;

* Line: absence of paint → canvas showing through   &#13;
* Creating space, represent space without depth while also creating surface tension &#13;

#### 1/25 Cubism&#13;
&#13;
Understand and recognize the differences between synthetic cubism &amp; analytic cubism   &#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; Synthetic: incorporation of external materials&#13;
&gt; Analytic: 1912 near abstraction&#13;
&#13;
Braque &amp; Picasso collaboration (ended by WW1) 1908-1914  &#13;
Analytic Cubism 1909-1912  &#13;
Synthetic Cubism 1912-1915  &#13;
Avant-garde movement based in Paris – significant influence in development of abstraction&#13;
&#13;
* counterpoint to Fauvism – which was about color, but Cubism is about form  &#13;
* external material incorporated into the painting&#13;
&#13;
Representation: from likeness to signification &#13;
&#13;
* Rejecting the idea of what art is – it doesn’t exist on a surface; it’s not decorative   &#13;
* Analysis of the nature of representation   &#13;
  * Representation: Imitation of likeness   &#13;
  * You can describe something that help viewers conjure their own image (there are non representational mode of painting)  &#13;
  * From the iconic to the linguistic mode of representation  &#13;
    * The signifer and the signified (the relationship is arbitrary) &#13;
&#13;
Collage&#13;
&#13;
Picasso &#13;
&#13;
* Move from naturalism to impressionism (date?)  &#13;
* Blue Period 1902  &#13;
* Rose Period 1905 (post-impressionism)  &#13;
* Interest in Iberian sculpture 1905-1906&#13;
&#13;
Matisse – abstract portraiture – both relate and opposite of Picasso &#13;
&#13;
* Achieve abstraction through:  &#13;
  * Matisse: Happen through non-naturalistic color   &#13;
  * Picasso: Transformation of form   &#13;
    * Conceptually more challenging than distortion of color   &#13;
  * Reintegration the debate between line and color  &#13;
* Continued use of Iberian mask late 1906   &#13;
* Culminates in Demoiselles 1907&#13;
&#13;
Braque *Houses at L’Estaque 1908* &#13;
&#13;
* What gave cubism the name   &#13;
* Digesting the lessons of Picasso and Cezanne  &#13;
  * Vs. *Mont Sainte Victoire* by Cezanne  &#13;
  * A more limited color palette, a simplification of form   &#13;
  * No sky, horizon line, creates a feeling of the form spilling forward rather than receding back   &#13;
  * The shading is not working in the opposite way  &#13;
    * Typically the light is closer to the audience and the shadow is further away   &#13;
    * Creating the sense that the volume is concave instead of convex &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Three Women* 1908&#13;
&#13;
* Every form is a triangle  &#13;
* Less cubes than facets   &#13;
* the different placement of the uniformed units signified the object – gets into the question of signification →  triangle in and of itself doesn’t indicate elbows but the placement of them created an elbow  &#13;
  * Relational model of meaning &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *The Reservoir Horta de Ebro 1909*  &#13;
Picasso *Houses on the hill horta de Ebro 1909*&#13;
&#13;
* Picasso digesting lessons from Cezanne  &#13;
* Shapes being relational   &#13;
* Seeing things from multiple perspectives on one plane all at the same time  &#13;
* Faceting of planes   &#13;
* Where we start to get into analytical cubism   &#13;
* Legibility of the structure of the subject starts to vanish over the next year or so&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Girl with a Mandolin 1910*&#13;
&#13;
* Geometric rendering of a human body  &#13;
* Also a rendering of shadow and light, line and plane as themselves arbitrary   &#13;
* Rather than producing likeness, representation through system of signification &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Braque *Violin and Palette* 1909&#13;
&#13;
* Playing w the same idea  &#13;
* Multiple perspective:  access to the front and the side at the same time   &#13;
* Structuring of the backgroun such that it occupies the same plane as the object  &#13;
* Cubism: a lot of musical instrument → reduced to their symbols    &#13;
* The nail on the top:  &#13;
  * Supporting the painter’s palette   &#13;
  * The shadow has a surprising legibility at this stage of Cubism  &#13;
  * Moment of trompe l’oeil   &#13;
    * Trick of the eye, convincing illusionism → something as occupying our space   &#13;
    * Another register of representation   &#13;
    * The nail could be actually piercing the painting and leaving a shadow on the canvas &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Standing Female Nude 1910*&#13;
&#13;
* Not interested in non-representation, or non objective   &#13;
* Will always remain engaged with representation, at the limit of representation   &#13;

* Lines don’t depict anything, but indicate bodies in the context, shading itself rendered arbitary&#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Kahnweiler* *1910*&#13;
&#13;
* Shimmer of facets   &#13;
* Vs. *Girl w a mandolin*  &#13;

&#13;
Braque *The Portuguese* 1911&#13;
&#13;
* A man standing on a dock, playing guitar   &#13;
* He has a lil mustache ahahah so cute\!  &#13;
* Radical reduction of form, of color palette, of shadow and line   &#13;
* Color and shading don’t designate form but rather cursory outlines do&#13;
&#13;
Picaso *Ma Jolie* 1911&#13;
&#13;
* Introduction of lettering → pointing us to collage   &#13;
* Title also a name of a popular song   &#13;
* Picasso’s most abstract painting   &#13;
* Reduction of form to intermittent grid w a general triangle format to indicate a body  &#13;
* Vs. the Red Studio (Fauvism): Achieving flatness through totally different means  &#13;

Picasso *Still Life w Chair Canning* 1912&#13;
&#13;
* Oil cloth pasted onto the canvas  &#13;

  * *Jou* representing newspaper → mass production &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Guitar* 1912&#13;
&#13;
* Vs. Grebo Mask  &#13;
  * Eyes protruding; signified through a presence rather than absence   &#13;
* Similarly, the cylinder stands in for the whole   &#13;
  * An understanding of the sign  &#13;
    * A statement of the arbitrariness of sign in a visual medium  &#13;
    * While the cylinder is represented in an opposite mode, it’s immediately understood by the view   &#13;
    * Bois: Historicizing the formal structure of the work   &#13;
    * Semiotic reading: Lines are signs and are relational, just like how letters only come to be words in relation to other letters   &#13;
      * Semiotics as a mode of formal analysis   &#13;
    * Meaning comes from the different parts coming together in the work  &#13;
* Significance: demoiselles uses African elements to produce shock, for their stylistic disjunction; here the eyes are used as a factor of shock &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Guitar and Wineglass 1912*&#13;
&#13;
* Integrating mass culture into the painting  &#13;
* Wallpaper, wood grain, newspaper, sheet music   &#13;
* Wineglass: analytical cubism; pasted into the collage   &#13;
  * Picasso thinking about the style that he developed w Braque as another representational mode of depicting something   &#13;

  * The different sizes of the f holes stand in for the fact that the violin is at an angle &#13;
&#13;
Picasso *Au Bon Marché* 1913&#13;
&#13;
* A lot of puns &#13;
&#13;

###### *“Primitivism”* &#13;
&#13;
* An aesthetic idealization that emulates the experience of “primitive” forms of life. This “life” is often itself seen as a counterweight to civilization and to modernism  &#13;
  * As exoticism: recreates colonial stereotypes, presenting the “other”   &#13;
  * As nostalgia   &#13;
* Form: the recreation or use of simple forms of representation such as those found in naive or folk art   &#13;
  * Ex: Henri Rousseau *The Dream* 1910  &#13;
    * Have the qualities of a surrealist painting  &#13;

&#13;
Expressionism and Exoticism &#13;
&#13;
* Influenced by Gaugin and other European artists such as Picasso, exotic art was seen as original and pure in contrast to a decadent and distorted european establishment   &#13;
* Around 1900 ethnological museums in Europe began to display artifacts from “primitive” peoples&#13;
&#13;
The “Primitive” and the modern&#13;
&#13;
* “The most perfect style in its regularity, the style of the highest abstraction… is characteristic of peoples at their most primitive cultural level” (Worringer)  &#13;
* Lamprecht believe in a “correspondence between the psyche of primeval cultures and the mental state of the present day”&#13;
&#13;
Authenticity&#13;
&#13;

#### Midterm Concept Review: &#13;
&#13;
**1886-1905 Post-Impressionism**&#13;
&#13;
* reaction against Impressionists' concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and color  &#13;
* sought to bring a more systematic approach to the structure and form of painting  &#13;
* Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne all shared an interest in making art that went beyond the mere representation of the natural world, focusing instead on expressing more abstract, emotional, and spiritual concepts&#13;
&#13;
Synthetism (subset of Post-impressionism)&#13;
&#13;
* Key figure: Paul Gauguin  &#13;
  * Particularly his work in Tahiti: synthesized the outward appearance of the subject matter with the artist's feelings about the subject and the aesthetics of the painting itself (does it also fall under primitivism?)  &#13;
* emphasizes two-dimensional flat patterns, thus rejecting three-dimensional perspective  &#13;
* Characterized by the use of bold flat forms separated by dark contours  &#13;
* Using color symbolically rather than realistically &#13;
&#13;
Neoimpressionism (another subset of post-impressionism)&#13;
&#13;
* response to Impressionism: interested in applying scientific research in optics and color theory to create a more harmonious and structured form of art compared to the more spontaneous and subjective approach of the Impressionists  &#13;
* Key figures: Georges Seurat and Paul Signac  &#13;
* most famous for its development of Pointillism (or Divisionism), a technique involving the application of paint in small dots of pure color, which are intended to blend in the viewer's eye&#13;
&#13;
**1900-1908 Fauvism (transitional stage to Cubism)**&#13;
&#13;
* pure, brilliant colour aggressively applied straight from the paint tubes to create a sense of an explosion on the canvas  &#13;
* Focus on nature (like the Impressionists)   &#13;
* Key figure: Matisse  &#13;
  * reject traditional renderings of three-dimensional space and to seek instead a new picture space defined by movement of colour&#13;
&#13;
**1908-1929 Cubism**&#13;
&#13;
* Key figures: Picasso, Braque   &#13;
* Emphasized flat, two-dimensional surface of the picture plane   &#13;
* rejecting the traditional techniques of perspective, foreshortening, modeling, and chiaroscuro  &#13;
* refuting theories that art should imitate nature&#13;
&#13;
Analytic Cubism (1910-1912)&#13;
&#13;
* While they moved away from naturalistic representation, they are very interested in the idea of representations and different modes of representation   &#13;
* Breaking down, analysis of form, display the essence of an object (or the complex totality of its subject) from multiple perspectives in a single two-dimensional framework  &#13;
* Picasso and Braque: simplified their colour schemes to a nearly monochromatic scale (hues of tan, brown, gray, cream, green, or blue were preferred) in order not to distract the viewer from the artist’s primary interest—the structure of form itself  &#13;
* Semiotics: The relationship between the signifer and the signified   &#13;
* What is the plane doing? move beyond the surface of the canvas rather than to recede in depth  &#13;
* representational motifs: letters, musical instruments, glasses etc. &#13;
&#13;
Synthetic Cubism (Post 1912\) &#13;
&#13;
* emphasize the combination, or synthesis, of forms in the picture  &#13;
* Colour assumes a strong role in these works  &#13;
* Shapes become more decorative   &#13;
* Trompe l’Oeil\!\!  &#13;
  * emphasizes the differences in texture and, at the same time, poses the question of what is reality and what is illusion  &#13;
* Key figures:  Fernand Léger, Sonia Delaunay, Juan Gris, Marcel Duchamp, Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger&#13;
&#13;
Salon Cubism&#13;
&#13;
* Coined to describe the works and the artists of Cubism who exhibited in various Paris Salons  &#13;
* Interested in the geometricizing of form&#13;
&#13;
**1905–1920 Expressionism**&#13;
&#13;
* artist seeks to depict not objective reality but rather the subjective emotions and responses that objects and events arouse within a person  &#13;
* Key artists: Van Gogh, Die Brücke, Ludwig Kirchner  &#13;
* artists used the expressive possibilities of colour and line to explore dramatic and emotion-laden themes, to convey the qualities of fear, horror, and the grotesque, or simply to celebrate nature with hallucinatory intensity&#13;
&#13;
Die Brücke 1905-1913&#13;
&#13;
* played a pivotal role in the development of Expressionism  &#13;
* Emphasized raw, emotional expression through vivid colors and bold strokes  &#13;
* founded by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner  &#13;
* Wanted to defy conventions of traditional painting as well as Impressionism and Post-Impressionism  &#13;
* subject matter—the human figure, landscape, portraiture, still life—executed in a simplified style that stressed bold outlines and strong colour planes&#13;
&#13;
Der Blaue Reiter 1911-1914&#13;
&#13;
* expressionistically oriented  &#13;
* Focused on spiritual and symbolic interpretations of art, with Kandinsky as a leading member  &#13;
* unlike Die Brücke, their expressionism took the form of lyrical abstraction.   &#13;
* imbued their art with deep spiritual content  &#13;
* influenced by the Jugendstil group, Cubism, Futurism, and “**naive**” folk art&#13;

# Basic Definitions&#13;
## Ethnicity&#13;
- a group identity based on a belief in a **common origin**&#13;
- Ethnic groups highlight (supposed) unique cultural aspects to mark inter-group differences and hierarchy&#13;
- Often ethnic identity definition is relative to external “others”&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; _Weber_: That belief is the foundation of identification with an ethnic group, solidarity among group members and definition of common goals.&#13;
&#13;
## Racial Division&#13;
- Social categorization based on **phenotypic** or **biological** criteria&#13;
&#13;
## Nationalism&#13;
- A group’s demand for autonomy in a territory considered to be the group’s homeland &#13;
- usually a demand for a **sovereign state**&#13;

# Ethnic boundaries and culture&#13;
## Social constructivist approach to ethnicity&#13;
- Ethnicity (and race, and nationhood) is a way of viewing the world. It belongs to the real of cognition (its “existence” not ontological but **phenomenological**).&#13;
- Ethnicity (and race, and nationhood) is a **social construct**: it is created and changes through social interactions and symbolic actions.&#13;
- Ethnic boundary making often through **inter-group competition**.&#13;
- Ethnicity has serious implications for people's lives.&#13;
&#13;
## _Jekins_: What is being constructed? &#13;
- Category's boundaries&#13;
- Beliefs about the traits or cultural contents that mark differences between 'us' and them”&#13;
&#13;
## Characteristics of the ethnic boundaries&#13;
- Ethnic boundaries are **fluid**.&#13;
- Ethnic boundaries are sometimes **blurred**.&#13;
- These principles contrast with common sensical view of ethnicity (and race and nation).&#13;
&#13;
## The development of the boundaries approach to ethnicity&#13;
- **Classic cultural anthropology** → Barth → Post Barth&#13;
&gt; Classic cultural anthropology classified ethnic and racial groups based on supposed objective traits.&#13;
&gt; Classification system reflected power relations imperialism and colonialism)&#13;
&#13;
## _Barth_: Ojective definition of ethnic boundries&#13;
- **Relationality**. Ethnic groups are not developed in isolation, but through **interactions** with other groups (key observation: people cross ethnic boundaries!). &#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; Groups are not defined by their culture, which is not an objective unique identifier (there are in-group differences and there are shared traits with out-groups) and changes over time. Ethnicity is a form of **social organization**.&#13;
- What matters is the **subjective demarcation** of boundaries between “us” and “them” by people in the field.&#13;
- Ethnic boundaries limit and prescribe social interactions.&#13;
-  Research should focus on the actions through which ethnic boundaries maintain or change.&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; There are no objective cultural markers of groups. Instead, people on the ground decide which cultural materials matter for their collective identity.&#13;
&#13;
## Post Barth Research&#13;
- Greater emphasis on the fluidity of ethnic boundaries.&#13;
- Interest in the links between symbolic boundaries and social boundaries.&#13;
- Situational ethnicity/ethnicity as cognition&#13;
- Setting the limits to constructivism&#13;
&#13;
## Social Boundary and Symbolic Boundary&#13;
### 1. Social Boundary&#13;
- Social boundaries refer to the tangible and observable divisions that exist in the real world, separating and distinguishing different social groups. &#13;
- These divisions can be based on various factors such as geography, ethnicity, class, religion, or political affiliations. &#13;
- Social boundaries can influence the distribution of resources, power dynamics, and social interactions among individuals and groups. &#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; Social boundaries are **objective** and have a **physical** presence, often manifested in institutional structures and societal norms.&#13;
### 2. Symbolic Boundary&#13;
- Symbolic boundaries are conceptual and constructed through cultural and symbolic representations. &#13;
- They involve the ways in which individuals and groups differentiate themselves and others based on shared meanings, values, and beliefs. &#13;
- Symbolic boundaries are not necessarily tied to physical or spatial separations; instead, they are rooted in the realm of ideas, language, and cultural practices. &#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; Symbolic boundaries are **subjective** and only have an **abstract** presence, they influence perceptions of identity, belonging, and group membership.&#13;
### Relationsips between Social and Symbolic boundaries&#13;
- Symbolic boundaries can **reinforce or challenge** social boundaries&#13;
&gt; Cultural representations and symbolic markers can strengthen group cohesion and reinforce social boundaries, leading to a sense of 'us versus them.' Conversely, symbolic boundaries can also be used to challenge and contest existing social boundaries, contributing to social change and transformation.&#13;
- Social boundaries can **be legitimized** through symbolic boundaries&#13;
&gt; The way a society conceptualizes and represents different social groups, often through media, language, and cultural practices, can legitimize and perpetuate existing social boundaries, either maintaining or reproducing social inequalities.&#13;
- Social boundaries may **influence the formation** of symbolic boundaries&#13;
&gt; The material conditions and power dynamics associated with social boundaries can shape the ways in which groups construct their symbolic boundaries. For example, oppressed or marginalized groups may use symbolic resistance as a means to challenge the dominant social order.&#13;
&#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; What is similar and what is different about the relationships of ethnicity with language and with religion?&#13;
&gt; ### Similar:&#13;
&gt; - Religion sometimes serves as a marker of ethnicity, but the two **do not fully overlap**. &#13;
&gt; - Highlighting religious differences is a political processes _(e.g., to justify claims for material, political, or symbolic resources)_&#13;
&gt; ### Difference:&#13;
&gt; - Sometimes, religion becomes a trans-ethnic or trans-national identity. &#13;
&gt; - Religions provide materials for thick ethnic (or national) identities: idioms, myths, and symbols that add moral and affective load to group membership.&#13;
&gt; - Religious organizations participate in ethnic (or national) identity **construction and socialization**.&#13;
&#13;
## Further viewpoints&#13;
- Culture marks ethnic boundaries, but it also gives content and meaning to **identities** _(“thick identity”)_.&#13;
- This does not mean that we should essentialize ethnic or national culture.&#13;
- Ethnic and national groups are sites of struggles over the meanings attached to **a collective identity** (e.g., different beliefs about the group’s history, its core values, etc., sometimes also about symbolic boundaries).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&#13;
# Boundary Work and Shifts&#13;
## _Nagel_: What caused large-scale ethnic switching? What caused the **fluidity**?&#13;
- Federal policy&#13;
- Ethnic politics&#13;
- Political activism, shared fate, pride, and inspiration&#13;
&#13;
## Characteristics of fluid boundaries:&#13;
- **Cultural differentiation**&#13;
&gt; i.e., identifying certain cultural traits, habits, behaviors, etc. as typical for “us” or for “them”&#13;
- **Social closure**&#13;
&gt; closure and differentiation tend to reinforce each other&#13;
- **Political salience**&#13;
&gt; “thick” identities reduce the range of possible political actions; ethnic politics tends to reinforce differentiation and closure&#13;
&#13;
## Boundary work&#13;
- The phenomenon of individuals or groups **creating, maintaining, adjusting, or breaking through** various boundaries in society, such as ethnic, cultural, social, etc., **to shape identity, group relationships, and social interactions**.&#13;
- Ethnic categories may **expand or contract** (a focal topic in ethnic studies) due to boundary work.&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; _Wimmer_: People have repertoires of identities to chose from. Their choices may change when institutional incentives change. So, **repertories ≠ situational ethnicity**.&#13;
&#13;
## Components of Boundary Work&#13;
- **Type of boundary**&#13;
&gt; which criteria for similarity/difference (e.g., ethnicity, race, gender, nationality, generation) is highlighted in the pursue or recognition and/or political power?&#13;
- **Type of strategy**&#13;
&gt; e.g., boundary crossing; normative inversion; expansion; contraction&#13;
- **Location of boundary**&#13;
&gt; membership rule: what is the criterion or threshold for being one of “us”?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&#13;
# Pan-ethnicity, situational ethnicity, the limit of constructivism&#13;
## Situational Ethnicity&#13;
-  Individuals or groups actively choosing to emphasize or express a specific ethnic identity in a particular context. &#13;
- This identity is determined by the current social environment, social situations, or specific contexts, and may change due to different situations.&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; Individuals or groups selectively emphasize or conceal their ethnic identity based on different social contexts to **adapt to different social needs or express a sense of belonging**. &#13;
&#13;
## Impacts of (activated) ethnic identification (self or other) on social interactions&#13;
-  Cognitive schemes of interpretation (_Brubaker：Ethnicity as Cognition_)&#13;
- Affective dispositions (sometimes _hot cognition_)&#13;
- Behavioral tendencies&#13;
- But interactions can also generate shifts in the above _(e.g., contact theory)_&#13;
&#13;
## Two types of variation in ethnic identification&#13;
- **Temporal** (i.e., the conditions that evoke different degrees and expressions of ethnic identification).&#13;
&gt; e.g., In certain specific social events or cultural celebrations, individuals may express their ethnic identity more strongly, while in other everyday contexts, ethnic identity may be relatively weak or less prominent.&#13;
- **Cross-sectional**: hierarchies of identities (i.e., identities’ relative degree of salience).&#13;
&gt; e.g., A person may emphasize their professional identity more in the workplace, while emphasizing their ethnic identity more at family gatherings.&#13;
&#13;
## Instrumental ethnicity&#13;
- Sometimes ethnicity is used instrumentally, but that is because it has been **internalized** and is considered **primordial**. &#13;
- Also, there is a difference between superficial act of signaling and deep act of adopting/embracing an identity.&#13;
- The content of ethnic identity functions as a **filter** through which personal and collective goals are defined and sorted.&#13;
&#13;

# Managing ethnic diversity&#13;
## What is a nation?&#13;
### Defition: &#13;
_Anderson (Imagined Communities, p.6):_ An imagined political community-and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign. &#13;
### What composes this definition?&#13;
- **Imagined**&#13;
&gt; Even in the smallest of all nations, a member will **never** know, meet, or event hear about most other members. However, the shared nation 'exists' in the consciousness of its members.&#13;
- **Limited**&#13;
&gt; People imagined nations as **bounded**: in our minds, the world population is divided to distinct nations. Perceived criteria for national membership. There are Rules for how to join 'our' nation.&#13;
- **Sovereign**&#13;
&gt; The nation is perceived by its members and outsiders who recognize its existence as sovereign or at least entitled to sovereignty. That makes the nation a **political community**: nations should **run their own business based on shared goals**.&#13;
- **Community**&#13;
&gt; The nation as an extended family or fraternity: a group whose members **share an equality at a profound level**. A community of feelings, solidarity, loyalty, and sometimes sacrifice (of people who are mostly **anonymous** to each other and also **unequal** in many respects).&#13;
&#13;
## How are (some) of the components may be related to ethnicity and interethnic relations?&#13;
- Nationhood (_sovereign_) and Nation-ness (_internal unity and cohesion_)&#13;
- A community of feelings and shared fate via the cultural stuff&#13;
- Ethnic mythology and symbols in the service of nationalism&#13;
- Myths of origin and antiquity&#13;
- A scared land via 'poetic spaces' _(e.g., archeological sites, battle fields, monuments, national map)._&#13;
- Golden age, national heroes. &#13;
- The collective past as a moral yardstick for evaluating the present and blueprint for the future via collective goals _(i.e., national revival)._&#13;
&#13;
## What is nation-state?&#13;
- A **territorially bounded sovereign** polity-ie., a state - that is **ruled in the name of a community** of citizens who **identify themselves as a nation**.&#13;
- A fusion of two principles: **state** sovereignty and **national** sovereignty.&#13;
- Nation-state institutions nurture **national sentiments**.&#13;
&gt; For members of the nation, 'their' state (which they usually see as their homeland) is the object of love, commitment or yearning.&#13;
&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; This definition highlights that **the authority of governments** of nation-state is based on the **claim-made inwards** (i.e., the people) and **outwards** (i.e., the international community)-that the government rules in the name of a nation.&#13;
&#13;
## Solutions to the problem of incongruence of cultural and political boundaries&#13;
### Reducing / eliminating diversity：&#13;
- Oppression (by authoritarian regimes)&#13;
- Ethnic cleansing&#13;
﻿- Assimilation policies through centralized education and cultural institutions&#13;
### Managing diversity: &#13;
- Political arrangements that contain ethnic diversity and reduce conflict&#13;
&#13;
## Typology of Democracies&#13;
- Republican liberal&#13;
- Individual liberal&#13;
- Consociational&#13;
- Multicultural&#13;
- ﻿﻿Ethnic democracy&#13;
&#13;
## Some of the challenges to inclusionary management of diversity&#13;
- **Large migrations** &#13;
&gt; less assimilation + postnational incorporation (_Soysal_); resistance by host societies&#13;
- **Indigenous Movements** &#13;
&gt; request greater respect and protection for their culture and rights&#13;
- The rise of **neo-nationalism** &#13;
&gt; resulting in exclusion of multiculturalism, and even triggering discrimination and hostility towards specific ethnic or cultural groups&#13;
- Empowerment of **populist-authoritarian leaders**&#13;
&gt; tend to emphasize nationalism and xenophobia, and hold a hostile attitude towards ethnic minorities and immigrants&#13;
&#13;
## What is 'postliberal' politics / citizenship?&#13;
- Demanding **recognition** in cultural uniqueness of ethnic minority _(resistance to complete assimilation)_.&#13;
- Claiming **collective rights** for ethnic groups _(in addition to equal/just distribution of resources)_.&#13;
- Demanding **autonomy** within the state for ethnic groups in their traditional territories.&#13;
- Demanding maintenance and extension of **civil rights**.&#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; Citizenship allows **contradictions** between autonomy and civil rights _(e.g., patriarchal norms)_&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
# Ethic stratification and inequality&#13;
## What is a **Social Stratification**?&#13;
- **Institutionalized** inequality (including legitimizing ideology)&#13;
- Inequality between **social categories**&#13;
- Inequality in access to different types of **resources** _(e.g., economic, political, legal, health, etc.)_&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt;Ethnic stratification: A state of at least **partial alignment** of ethnic division and social stratification.&#13;
&#13;
## How does status translate into economic advantages?&#13;
- Ethnic division of **labor** (monopoly over certain occupations)&#13;
- **Endogamy** (marriage as an economic exchange)&#13;
- **Stereotypes** (affect the judgment of employment, landlords, policemen, judges, etc.)&#13;
- **Ideology** may justify alignment of status and class&#13;
&#13;
## Ethnic stratification via **Political Arrangements**&#13;
- Ethnic stratification in **colonial and postcolonial** states&#13;
- **Global stratification** (_citizenship as a resource_)&#13;
&gt; There is an unequal distribution of opportunities, privileges, and resources among individuals and groups in different countries or regions. &#13;
&#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; In this context, citizenship is seen as a valuable resource that **grants individuals specific rights, protections, and benefits** based on their country of origin or nationality.&#13;
&#13;
- **Group discrimination** by state institutions&#13;
- Differential access to certain **jobs**&#13;
- Mechanisms of inclusion/exclusion of **immigrants** based on their ethnicities&#13;
&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
# Assimilation/Integration/Segregation/Incorporation of Immigrant Ethnic minorities&#13;
## _Portes and Zhou_: Three types of **Acculturation Approach**:&#13;
- **Adoption** of the dominant culture and assimilation in the **middle-class**.&#13;
- **Adoption** of a counter-culture and assimilation in **lower classes**.&#13;
- Social and economic **mobility** through maintenance of an ethnic group's culture, values, and solidarity.&#13;
&#13;
## The Impact of the Context in the Receiving Country and Society&#13;
- Government policy: receptive, indifferent, or hostile&#13;
- Societal reception: Prejudiced or nonprejudiced&#13;
- Co-ethnic community: Weak or strong&#13;
&#13;
## What drives certain groups to 'choose' differentiation/assimilation?&#13;
- Skin color&#13;
- Place of residence&#13;
- Economic shifts&#13;
- Capacity to utilize them though different types of capital&#13;
&#13;
## The long-term effects of the 'context'&#13;
- **Government's assistance** to immigrants improves their children's (and their children's) mobility chances.&#13;
- Sometime **negative stereotypes** persist for generations.&#13;
- Immigrant's decision to join strong ethnic community may affect the **mobility of their offspring**.&#13;
&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&lt;br/&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
# Ethnic Violence&#13;
## Types of ethnic violence&#13;
-  Ethnic riot &#13;
- Lynch  &#13;
- Pogrom &#13;
- Ethnocide _(of culture)_&#13;
- Genocide (of people)&#13;
- Inter-state wars may include an ethnic component&#13;
- Civil wars&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; Some ethnic conflicts include **more than one** type of violence.&#13;
&#13;
## Previous reasons for collective violence：&#13;
- Violence is **natural**; a human tendency that had developed through evolution.&#13;
- **Socialization** to violence&#13;
&gt; (a) arguments about **failed socialization**; (b) arguments about socialization to **non-normative behavior**.&#13;
- **Psychoanalytical** argument&#13;
&gt; e.g., (a) violence as **externalization of interna tensions**; (b) violence as projection of suppressed traumatic social relationships (for instance, _child-parents or child-teacher_).&#13;
- **Crowd** psychology&#13;
&gt; people become violent during collective action that causes **de-individuation and extasy**&#13;
&#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; Classic arguments are partial explanation that point to possible roots of **people’s motivation** to participate in ethnic violence, but they **cannot explain instances** of ethnic violence.&#13;
&#13;
## _Ted Robert Gurr_: Reasons for ethnic violence&#13;
- The basis of violence is frustration (frustration-aggression theory).&#13;
- Frustration stems from relative deprivation (not necessarily economic).&#13;
- An ethnic group’s leadership utilizes feelings of frustration and anger to mobilize them for protest and violence. Sometimes this is done as a cold-minded strategy.&#13;
&#13;
## Characteristics of Ethnic Riot&#13;
- Brutal&#13;
- Highly passionate, but with clear patterns &#13;
&gt; e.g., target selection, common order: trigger event, rumors spread, escalation, (expansion to other places), decline.&#13;
- Violence as meaning for **participants**&#13;
- Violence has **general and immediate causes** &#13;
&gt; distal/proximate causes&#13;
&gt; Violence reflects ethnic/racial **cleavages**, but it is not a necessary outcome of the cleavages&#13;
- A process with internal dynamic&#13;
- **Trigger** events often have special **symbolic meanings**&#13;
- **Leaders** may provoke feelings of frustration, rage, hatred, and fear&#13;
&gt; including by employing elements of **collective memory**&#13;
- **Rumors** are a key mechanism of mass mobilization for active or passive support.&#13;
- **Aggressive reaction** by the rival validate negative feelings and sense of righteousness, thus propagate violence&#13;
- Violence converts negative feelings to **positive feelings**&#13;
&gt; solidarity, pride, hope, even euphoria _(Tambiah: Jubilant Destruction)_&#13;
&#13;
## _Wimmer_: The Political Context of Violent Ethnic Conflicts&#13;
- Statistical association between ethnic violence and **political competition and exclusion**&#13;
&gt; – Ethnic uprising is more common in **ethnocracies**.&#13;
&gt; – Ethnic violence (especially coup attempts) is more common when ruling is divided between the **elites** of several ethnic groups.&#13;
&gt; – Ethnic uprising and coup attempts are more common in countries where an **ethnic minority has a history of controlling** part or the entire territory. &#13;
- Ethnic violence during the **collapse** of a polity &#13;
&gt; e.g., the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia. Mechanisms: political opportunity, contagion, security dilemma.&#13;
- Violence during or after **elections** &#13;
&gt; e.g., Kenya 2007-8 following rumors that the elections were stolen from the Kikuyu.&#13;
- Cities with **intense political competition** experience more ethnic violence&#13;
&#13;
## How people choose attitudes towards violence?&#13;
- **Rational choice**: Expected benefits/risks&#13;
&gt; Mechanisms: Social control, policing&#13;
&#13;
&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
&gt; It is possible that rational choice is more typical of specific phases of conflicts (e.g., after escalation or when it gets clearer who is going to win)&#13;
&#13;
- **Symbolic politics**: Participation in violence is emotional and sentimental (especially hatred and rage toward the enemy).&#13;
&gt; Mechanisms: &#13;
&gt; - People’s tendency to protect their group from symbolic threats or existential threats&#13;
&gt; - Elite’s manipulative use of ethnic myths and symbols to provoke hatred, rage, and fear of the enemy + internal solidarity and excitement &#13;
&gt; - Symbolic politics flattens identities, creates “collective mind”: identity dichotomy (us/them), stereotypical thinking (good/evil) &#13;
&gt; - Affective reactions: positive feelings about the home group and negative feelings about the enemy&#13;
&gt; - A spiral of revenge and escalation &#13;
- **Institutionalized violence**: Routinization and ritualization of violence&#13;
&gt; Circumstances and Mechanisms: &#13;
&gt; - Non-violent ethnic protests deteriorates to violence&#13;
&gt; - Actors that keep the ethnic conflicts “burning” (some of them provoke violence during crises : politicians, religious leaders, mural painters, gangs, local media&#13;
&gt; - Many ordinary people have experience, or at least memories from past episodes of violence: they “know” what their role is likely to be; they remember the solidarity and elation they felt; they may wait for an opportunity for revenge&#13;
&gt; - Therefore, the violence process looks like a ritual with clear roles and a predicted pattern of development&#13;
&gt; - In some cities, violence is expected, almost trivial&#13;
&#13;
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]&#13;
&gt; The three attitudes are **not mutually exclusive** and may appear as one or multiple simultaneously。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://Yuezi-1223.github.io/yuezi.github.io/post/Study%20Note%20-%20Ethnic%20Divisions%20and%20Segregation%2C%20Harvard%202023.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 13:31:19 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
