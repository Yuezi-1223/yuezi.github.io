 #### 1/16 Post-Impressionism

**Impressionism**  
developed in France in the 19C. century and is based on the practice of painting out of doors and spontaneously 'on the spot' rather than in a studio from sketches

* Produced an unfinished look in paintings  
* Reflected fleeting moments  
* Painted scenes that looked fuzzy and unrefined  
* Used short, quick brush strokes  
* Key artists: Monet, Degas, Pissarro   
  * Monet: uses **natural pastel hue**   
* Motivation: create the impression of a moment (idea comes from realism), focuses on lighting  

**Post Impressionism** 

* Artists move further away from academic naturalism (towards abstraction)  
* Strong influence non-European art and culture (Japanese prints, Primitivism)  
* Key Artists: Gauguin, Van Gogh  
  * Expressive color  
  * Painting as subjective expression: how art can evoke emotions   
  * Painting as escape from anxieties of modern life  
* Cezanne, Seurat  
  * Geometric stability  
  * Attention to form and structure  
  * Seurat: manipulates color, develops pointillism 

Gauguin, *Vision after the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel)*, 1888

* Post impressionism   
* Color: white and red/ impasto red dramatic   
* Theosophy   
* Breton women, dressed in distinctive regional costume, have just listened to a sermon based on a passage from the Bible  
* Background: divided by diagonal tree trunk   
* Gauguin First religious picture, wanted to give it to a church  
* Churches denied lol 

#### 1/18 Modernism & The female Nude: Picasso's Les demoiselles d' Avigonon

**Context:**   
1907  
How the painting represents the relationship between the female nude and modernism  
History of western art and the Renaissance   
Immediate context in which Picasso made this painting   
General reception of the painting 

Picasso:

- Known as the inventor of cubism   
- Known for Guernica (anti-war painting in 1937\)


- Picasso skilled at naturalism, creating an image that looks lifelike   
- An opportunity to think about abstraction   
- Abstraction is about deconstruction of representation   
- A result of specific set of choices 

Within the western tradition, long history of images/ sculpture of nude figures   
At the center of Greek art was the male nude (Michelangelo’s David; Antonio’s Perseus)

- Male figure \- heroic   
- The accurate depiction of male nude \- highest level of artist achievement 

In contrast, female nude:

- Nude image of female had an erotic function   
- William Hogarth, Marriagea la Mode: curtain drawn over a female nude bc it’s so overly erotic   
- Titles like: sleeping venus; Rokeby Venus; the Toilette of Venus (god of love) \-\> a mythological pretext for her nudity  
- Distort female body to show more nudity  
- Emerged in the context of italian renaissance that insisted upon the gap of the functions of male and female nudity 

Edouard Manuet \- broke the historical tradition 

- Olympia, 1863 (referencing Venus of Urbino) \- first modernist painting   
  - Depicts the modern life  
  - Declares the surface of painting, acknowledges the existence of the canvas   
  - Frankness of her stare suggests a transactional relationship btw viewers of the painting and her  
  - Flowers brought to her by a woman who’s her servant (African descent) from her next client   
- A hinge btw the history of reclining female nude and its modern iteration  
- Deliberately updates the figure, no longer a mythological figure of Venus but explicitly a modern sex worker   
- The way in which he compressed the space (compared to Venus of Urbino) \- darkness → shallow background, brightness of white presses forward   
  - Establishes a precedent of avant garde shock that happens through the female nude

Paul Gauguin, Copy of Manuet’s Olympia 1891

- A deliberate conversation   
- Modernism is worked through the body of female nude  
    
  Sex workers/ women, an emblem of modernism “The New Woman”  
- The beautiful girl 1919  
- Street, berlin, 1913

Paul Cezanne, The large bathers, 1906

- He challenges the fundamental assumptions of naturalism  
- Ex: this work depicts the real world but also presents itself as a painting through  
  - The breaking open of form (the distortion of tree branches; the relationship between the trunk and the sky)

Matisse paints Bonheur de vive (in conversation w the painting above)

- Abstraction  
- Emptying out of form  
- Emphasis on outline  
- Discrete scenes: idealized and pastoral   
- Trying to create a modern, classical grandeur   
- Pleasing to look at

Gertrude Stein: hangs up this painting, seen by Picasso   
Picasso was in the process of painting the portrait of Gertrude Stein, saw Matisse’s painting as a challenge and came up w Les Demoiselles d Avignon  

- The painting of Gertrude Stein reflects his interest in form

**Les Demoiselles d Avignon** (Symbolic of Picasso’s misogyny and racism)  
No pastoral setting, no bright colors  
everything is angular    
Red light district in Barcelona (Spanish sex workers)  
Shallow space → compression achieved through a lack of background detail; a tangled of bodies; disproportion of faces  
stylistic dysjunction (multiple styles happening in one painting)

- Faces resemble → Dan mask; Baule mask → signifies Africaness/ a monstrosity

Flatness of figures   
Presence of a reclining figure (second on the left)

- Makes more sense if she were to be lying down  
- Rendering her hinged up at the viewers  
- Further compresses the space, a furthering of abstraction  
- What does that achieve?   
  - The figure becomes confrontational   
  - Gazes are multiplied (compared to Olympia), extending the dialogue  
  - Olympia confronts the everyday male viewer w his own practices of sexuality and how that’s comodified   
  - Whereas Picasso is aiming to further the shock factor, to further highlight to the male viewers the banality of the everyday life; updates a classic genre, intentionally   
    - Through the extension of flattening, the multiplication of gazes  
- Figure on the very left  
  - Holding open a curtain for viewers to survey her body

Nowhere for the eyes to go, attention gets thrown back to the foreground  
(white and black are used to render volume, which the painting lacks)  
The fruit at the bottom of the canvas 

- Putting viewers at the table, engaging with and confronting the women directly

Understood as a formal innovation that led to Cubism 

Primitivism in 20th C.: Western writers conceive the cultural other as an authenticity, as a sight of other than themselves, rather than reflecting about the differences 

Ringgold, Picasso’s Studio

- Picasso becomes a side character in the story of modernism 

#### 1/23 Post-Impressionism (Continue)

Divisionism: reflecting on the division of plane into infinite dots  
Pointillism 

- Two directions that artists go to engage w colors (differentiation vs synthesis) 

###### *Georges Seurat*

Interested in scientific approach to color, to bringing stability and classical quality to impressionism   
And thinking about class in the contemporary context

* Bathers at Asnieres 1884  
  * Working class leisure   
  * Lower class status  
  * Context: Pastoral, mythological settings of traditional bather paintings   
* Sunday Afternoon 1884  
  * Middle class leisure   
  * Mature style → more dotted    
* Le chahut 1889  
  * Performance as a social context, not an image of performance isolated from its context Create opportunities for a rich patterning of colors → stability of subject, contradicts the content  
  * Stability vs. movement (classism, solemnity)  
* Parade de cirque 1887  
  * Bourgeois, leisure, at night

###### *Cezanne* 

Influential figure for the development of cubism, not totally post impressionist bc approach looks very different from impressionist   
Breaking open closed form

* Still Life w Basket of apples 1893  
  * Stuffy genre → still life   
  * Creating a scene w multiple diff perspectives   
  * Edge of table doesn’t line up, the corners don’t match  
  * Thick application of paint for napkin: Creating a sense of structure, of folds  
  * Overall composition: disorienting   
    * Trying to paint in a way that reflect the way our eyes engage w paintings → not linear, not single point perspective; our eyes wander around   
    * Breaking the standard criteria of composition since Renaissance which is the idea of a unified image (→ painting has to present one thing from one view) \- Deconstruction of tradition   
    * Representation vs reality: how painting constructs representation   
    * Interested in the materiality of color; Brush strokes: constructing forms w paint   
* Mont sainte Victoire 1885  
  * Disintegration of form   
  * Lack of outline: truck of tree vs un outlined zone next to it  
  * Recession of space, tree established a sense of distance   
* Mont Sainte Victoire 1902  
  * Repeated patches of color \- pixelated \- sit on the surface of the canvas   
  * Stacked up vertically, no sense of space   
  * Bleeding of forms \- breaking open of form itself; form isn’t a coherent thing, designated by outlines or not; Key principle that Cezanne is challenging   
  * Analysis of representation through the materiality of painting   
* The Large Bathers 1906  
* Bathers 1894-1905  
  * Drawing on a tradition of scenes of bathers   
    * idealized natural setting, mythological context (Diana and Callisto 1635; Pastoral Symphony 1510\)  
    * Bathing: pretext for nudity   
  * Cezanne and Seurat continue the tradition  
    * Interest in using new techniques to engage traditional subjects 

Impressionists: Momentarily experience w naturalism   
Post impressionist: artist capture their own experience in a subjective way 

- Everyone is motivated by the desire to access truth, to make a painting that feels true and real, whether its through personal temperament or objective perspective   
- Idea of Expressionism is emerging 

###### *Chronology of Matisse & Fauvism* 

Salon d’Automne, 1905

* Key moment of Fauvism  
  * Short lived movement, influential, head figure: Matisse  
  * Matisse \+ Picasso

Paul Signac: advocate for divisionist technique, for neo impressionism 

* Golde Juan 1896: Experimenting w non naturalistic color   
* Matisse studied with Signac

Luxe calm et Volupte 1904 (compared w Island of la Grande Jatte) \- Pre Fauvist work 

* Both reflects neo impressionism and deviates from it   
* Devisionist technique: dots bigger and elongated; Seurat would never paint in dashes

The Red Studio 1911

* Tradition of artists painting about their studio  
* Defeat our eyes desire to read depth   
  * Red flattens the space (like Vision after the Sermon by Gauguin)  
  * Lines don’t work to create a coherent senes of space (don’t become narrorwers as they move away from the viewers)   
* Line: absence of paint → canvas showing through   
* Creating space, represent space without depth while also creating surface tension 

After 1911, Matisse engaged w cubism

The Piano Lesson 1916  
Dance II  
Swimming Pool 1952: Using cutouts, papers and scissors as his primary medium

- Collapses into just the surface (color as shape) 

#### 1/25 Cubism

Understand and recognize the differences between synthetic cubism & analytic cubism   
> [!NOTE]
> Synthetic: incorporation of external materials
> Analytic: 1912 near abstraction

Braque & Picasso collaboration (ended by WW1) 1908-1914  
Analytic Cubism 1909-1912  
Synthetic Cubism 1912-1915  
Avant-garde movement based in Paris – significant influence in development of abstraction

* counterpoint to Fauvism – which was about color, but Cubism is about form  
* external material incorporated into the painting

Representation: from likeness to signification 

* Rejecting the idea of what art is – it doesn’t exist on a surface; it’s not decorative   
* Analysis of the nature of representation   
  * Representation: Imitation of likeness   
  * You can describe something that help viewers conjure their own image (there are non representational mode of painting)  
  * From the iconic to the linguistic mode of representation  
    * The signifer and the signified (the relationship is arbitrary) 

Collage

Picasso 

* Move from naturalism to impressionism (date?)  
* Blue Period 1902  
* Rose Period 1905 (post-impressionism)  
* Interest in Iberian sculpture 1905-1906

Matisse – abstract portraiture – both relate and opposite of Picasso 

* Achieve abstraction through:  
  * Matisse: Happen through non-naturalistic color   
  * Picasso: Transformation of form   
    * Conceptually more challenging than distortion of color   
  * Reintegration the debate between line and color  
* Continued use of Iberian mask late 1906   
* Culminates in Demoiselles 1907

Braque *Houses at L’Estaque 1908* 

* What gave cubism the name   
* Digesting the lessons of Picasso and Cezanne  
  * Vs. *Mont Sainte Victoire* by Cezanne  
  * A more limited color palette, a simplification of form   
  * No sky, horizon line, creates a feeling of the form spilling forward rather than receding back   
  * The shading is not working in the opposite way  
    * Typically the light is closer to the audience and the shadow is further away   
    * Creating the sense that the volume is concave instead of convex 

Picasso *Three Women* 1908

* Every form is a triangle  
* Less cubes than facets   
* the different placement of the uniformed units signified the object – gets into the question of signification →  triangle in and of itself doesn’t indicate elbows but the placement of them created an elbow  
  * Relational model of meaning 

Picasso *The Reservoir Horta de Ebro 1909*  
Picasso *Houses on the hill horta de Ebro 1909*

* Picasso digesting lessons from Cezanne  
* Shapes being relational   
* Seeing things from multiple perspectives on one plane all at the same time  
* Faceting of planes   
* Where we start to get into analytical cubism   
* Legibility of the structure of the subject starts to vanish over the next year or so


Picasso *Girl with a Mandolin 1910*

* Geometric rendering of a human body  
* Also a rendering of shadow and light, line and plane as themselves arbitrary   
* Rather than producing likeness, representation through system of signification 


Braque *Violin and Palette* 1909

* Playing w the same idea  
* Multiple perspective:  access to the front and the side at the same time   
* Structuring of the backgroun such that it occupies the same plane as the object  
* Cubism: a lot of musical instrument → reduced to their symbols    
* The nail on the top:  
  * Supporting the painter’s palette   
  * The shadow has a surprising legibility at this stage of Cubism  
  * Moment of trompe l’oeil   
    * Trick of the eye, convincing illusionism → something as occupying our space   
    * Another register of representation   
    * The nail could be actually piercing the painting and leaving a shadow on the canvas 

Picasso *Standing Female Nude 1910*

* Not interested in non-representation, or non objective   
* Will always remain engaged with representation, at the limit of representation   
* Interest of *the Three Women* repeated but extended   
* Lines don’t depict anything, but indicate bodies in the context, shading itself rendered arbitary

Picasso *Kahnweiler* *1910*

* Shimmer of facets   
* Vs. *Girl w a mandolin*  
* One figure but there’s repetition of the subject; multiple zones of figuration 

Braque *The Portuguese* 1911

* A man standing on a dock, playing guitar   
* He has a lil mustache ahahah so cute\!  
* Radical reduction of form, of color palette, of shadow and line   
* Color and shading don’t designate form but rather cursory outlines do

Picaso *Ma Jolie* 1911

* Introduction of lettering → pointing us to collage   
* Title also a name of a popular song   
* Picasso’s most abstract painting   
* Reduction of form to intermittent grid w a general triangle format to indicate a body  
* Vs. the Red Studio (Fauvism): Achieving flatness through totally different means  
  * Matisse: playing w color to create a flat decorative quality  
  * Picasso: interested in the nature of representation through arbitrariness 

Picasso *Still Life w Chair Canning* 1912

* Oil cloth pasted onto the canvas  
* Outline of a thick rope   
* External elements physically incorporated into a painting → Stylistic heterogeneity  
* Style: reflecting analytic cubism; introduction to collage   
* Physical materiality of a table \+ things on the table   
  * *Jou* representing newspaper → mass production 

Picasso *Guitar* 1912

* Vs. Grebo Mask  
  * Eyes protruding; signified through a presence rather than absence   
* Similarly, the cylinder stands in for the whole   
  * An understanding of the sign  
    * A statement of the arbitrariness of sign in a visual medium  
    * While the cylinder is represented in an opposite mode, it’s immediately understood by the view   
    * Bois: Historicizing the formal structure of the work   
    * Semiotic reading: Lines are signs and are relational, just like how letters only come to be words in relation to other letters   
      * Semiotics as a mode of formal analysis   
    * Meaning comes from the different parts coming together in the work  
* Significance: demoiselles uses African elements to produce shock, for their stylistic disjunction; here the eyes are used as a factor of shock 

Picasso *Guitar and Wineglass 1912*

* Integrating mass culture into the painting  
* Wallpaper, wood grain, newspaper, sheet music   
* Wineglass: analytical cubism; pasted into the collage   
  * Picasso thinking about the style that he developed w Braque as another representational mode of depicting something   
* Wallpaper is the body of the guitar but also the background  
* Poggi: contrasts Cubism w Symbolism – focus more on culture, social history   
  * Symbolists: exist in the industrialized culture but are rejecting in its images  
    * Interested in pre industrial   
  * Poggi argues that Picasso challenges the symbolist version of modernism which rejects the products of industrialization   
* Bois: focus more on the cultural other, form and structure, Picasso’s psychology

Braque *Fruit Dish and Glass*   
Papier collé

* Significance of mass culture 

Picasso *Violin* 1912

* Formal exploration of representation  
* Another example of Papier collé  
* Newspaper arranged vertically so viewers could read  
* Wood grain of the surface of the violin as well as the room/ wall exist on the same plane   
* Curve indicating the bottom of instrument   
* The f hole in the middle indicates that it’s a violin   
  * The different sizes of the f holes stand in for the fact that the violin is at an angle 

Picasso *Au Bon Marché* 1913

* A lot of puns 

Picasso *Glass of Absinthe* 1914 

* Translate the analytic cubist mode into a sculpture   
* A collaging sculpture   
* Pointilism as a motif: a scientific way of constructing solidity/ impressionism 

Picasso *Pipe and musical score* 1914

* What does it mean to display a picture   
* Wall paper appropriating as a frame   
* A real frame and a frame displayed within (shadow)  
* Pointilism as a motif again   
* Disjuntion of styles 

Picasso *Portrait of a young girl* 1914

* Return of color; color as material   
* Patches of both cubism and pointilism 

Picasso *Harlequin* 1915

* Maintenance of spatial ambiguity   
* Brown is the background but also a figure   
* form : Indicates body parts in relation to others  
* Patches of disjuntion of styles continued 

Picasso *Three Musicians* 1921

* Collage is informing an entire painted area  
* Synthesizing existing different planes   
* Move away from the confrontation w the mass culture   
* Reture to the large scale painting; return to order   
* WW1: Return to whole figures, naturalism, classism; coexist w abstraction   
  * How does one reconcile w that?  
    * Picasso likes stylistic disjunction   
    * Conversation between works  
    * Picasso’s career isn’t a straight line   
  * Interest in surrealism 

#### 1/30 Cubism II: Reception

Picasso: interested in the fundamental question of representation  
How do you represent something without necessarily repeating its appearance   
Methods and approaches to Cubism   
Cubism representing a linguistic model of representation  
Cubism as a kind of conceptual exercise   
Importance of Cubism’s influence

* Cubism as simultaneous, multiple perspectives  
* Cubism as movement on static surface   
* Cubism as geometricizing even purifying of form – machine aesthetic, modern classicism  
* Cubism as pointing to abstraction 

**Juan Gris**  
Approaching representation through a more playful approach  
More accessible than Picasso's painting 

*The Table* 1914  
Depicting silverware   
Woodgrain wallpaper as a naturalistic tabletop representation: a sight of illusion   
Naturalistic type of drawing compared to Picasso and Braque   
And objects retain structural integrity 

*Still Life: The Table* 1914  
Collage principle   
Text: the real and the fake   
Thinking about representation as a gap between reality and invention   
Invitation to the audience to unlock the image through the key   
Cigarette  
Cursory sketch of a cigarette 

*Still Life with Checked Tablecloth* 1915  
Optical illusion   
Interested in different registers of representation 

Henri Matisse *View of Notre-Dame* 1914  
Distorted geometric components   
Discontinuity   
Different shades of purple: schematic rendering of perspective   
Greater presence of line; darker

Henri Matisse *The Piano Lesson* 1916   
Head: multiple views   
Investigating structure

###### *Salon Cubism*

Salon cubists: Interested in participating in the salons 1911

——————————————————————————————————————————  
Classnotes from Avant-Garde:

###### *“Primitivism”* 

* An aesthetic idealization that emulates the experience of “primitive” forms of life. This “life” is often itself seen as a counterweight to civilization and to modernism  
  * As exoticism: recreates colonial stereotypes, presenting the “other”   
  * As nostalgia   
* Form: the recreation or use of simple forms of representation such as those found in naive or folk art   
  * Ex: Henri Rousseau *The Dream* 1910  
    * Have the qualities of a surrealist painting  
* Paul Gauguin 1848-1903  
  * In between impressionism and expressionism   
  * Left Europe in 1891 and leave behind everything “artifical and conventional”  
  * Simplicity and harmoney of the people whom he called “savages”  
  * What do we do w art that is morally corrupted? 

Expressionism and Exoticism 

* Influenced by Gaugin and other European artists such as Picasso, exotic art was seen as original and pure in contrast to a decadent and distorted european establishment   
* Around 1900 ethnological museums in Europe began to display artifacts from “primitive” peoples

The “Primitive” and the modern

* “The most perfect style in its regularity, the style of the highest abstraction… is characteristic of peoples at their most primitive cultural level” (Worringer)  
* Lamprecht believe in a “correspondence between the psyche of primeval cultures and the mental state of the present day”

Authenticity

* Kandinsky linked “spritual in art” w primitive thinking 

*After the Swim* 1912

* Inspired by African sculptures by Cubism and Picasso  
* Recalls the Brucke’s fav motif: bathing and dancing “exotic” girls

#### Midterm Concept Review: 

**1886-1905 Post-Impressionism**

* reaction against Impressionists' concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and color  
* sought to bring a more systematic approach to the structure and form of painting  
* Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cézanne all shared an interest in making art that went beyond the mere representation of the natural world, focusing instead on expressing more abstract, emotional, and spiritual concepts

Synthetism (subset of Post-impressionism)

* Key figure: Paul Gauguin  
  * Particularly his work in Tahiti: synthesized the outward appearance of the subject matter with the artist's feelings about the subject and the aesthetics of the painting itself (does it also fall under primitivism?)  
* emphasizes two-dimensional flat patterns, thus rejecting three-dimensional perspective  
* Characterized by the use of bold flat forms separated by dark contours  
* Using color symbolically rather than realistically 

Neoimpressionism (another subset of post-impressionism)

* response to Impressionism: interested in applying scientific research in optics and color theory to create a more harmonious and structured form of art compared to the more spontaneous and subjective approach of the Impressionists  
* Key figures: Georges Seurat and Paul Signac  
* most famous for its development of Pointillism (or Divisionism), a technique involving the application of paint in small dots of pure color, which are intended to blend in the viewer's eye

**1900-1908 Fauvism (transitional stage to Cubism)**

* pure, brilliant colour aggressively applied straight from the paint tubes to create a sense of an explosion on the canvas  
* Focus on nature (like the Impressionists)   
* Key figure: Matisse  
  * reject traditional renderings of three-dimensional space and to seek instead a new picture space defined by movement of colour

**1908-1929 Cubism**

* Key figures: Picasso, Braque   
* Emphasized flat, two-dimensional surface of the picture plane   
* rejecting the traditional techniques of perspective, foreshortening, modeling, and chiaroscuro  
* refuting theories that art should imitate nature

Analytic Cubism (1910-1912)

* While they moved away from naturalistic representation, they are very interested in the idea of representations and different modes of representation   
* Breaking down, analysis of form, display the essence of an object (or the complex totality of its subject) from multiple perspectives in a single two-dimensional framework  
* Picasso and Braque: simplified their colour schemes to a nearly monochromatic scale (hues of tan, brown, gray, cream, green, or blue were preferred) in order not to distract the viewer from the artist’s primary interest—the structure of form itself  
* Semiotics: The relationship between the signifer and the signified   
* What is the plane doing? move beyond the surface of the canvas rather than to recede in depth  
* representational motifs: letters, musical instruments, glasses etc. 

Synthetic Cubism (Post 1912\) 

* emphasize the combination, or synthesis, of forms in the picture
